### Strings
*Strings are sequences of characters contained within two quotes (either double or single - just be consistant!)*  

Strings may contain letters, digits, spaces or special characters  
```py
"String with a 3 in it!"
```

Strings can be bound to variables  
```py
string = "String with a 3 in it!"
```

### Indexing
Strings are best thought of as an ordered sequence.Each element in the sequence can be accessed using an index represented by the array of numbers. 

|S |t |r |i |n |g |  |w |i |t |h |  |a |  |3 |  |i |n |  |i |t |! |  
|- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |  
|0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 |10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|  

It is helpful to think of a string as an ordered sequence. Each element in the sequence can be accessed using an index represented by the array of numbers:

Items in the string can be accessed by referencing their index; indexing starts at 0.
<details><summary>Print the first element in the string</summary>

```py
print(string[0])
```

Will output:  
```
S
```
</details><p></p>

<details><summary>Print the fifth element in the string</summary>

```py
print(string[5])
```

Will output:  
```
g
```
</details><p></p>

**Negative Indexing**  
Negative indexing can be used with strings, negative index can help to count the element from the end of the string.

|S |t |r |i |n |g |  |w |i |t |h |  |a |  |3 |  |i |n |  |i |t |! |  
|- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |  
|0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 |10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|  



The last element is given by the index -1:  
<details><summary>Print the last element in the string</summary>

```py
print(string[-1])
```

Will output:  
```
!
```
</details><p></p>

The first element can be obtained by  index -21:
<details><summary>Print the first element in the string</summary>

```py
print(string[-21])
```

Will output:  
```
S
```
</details><p></p>

We can find the number of characters in a string by using `len()`, short for length:  
<details><summary>Find the length of string</summary>

```py
len(string)
```

Will output:  
```
22
```
</details><p></p>

**Slicing**  
Multiple characters can be obtained from a string using slicing.

|S |t |r |i |n |g |  |w |i |t |h |  |a |  |3 |  |i |n |  |i |t |! |  
|- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |  
|0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 |10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|  

When taking a slice, the first number indictaes the starting index (start at 0), and the second number indictes the length of the slice (start at 1).  
<details><summary>Take the first 4 characters of the variable</summary>

```py
string[0:4]
```

Will output:  
```
'Stri'
```
</details><p></p>

<details><summary>Slice the variable string with only index 8 to index 11</summary>

```py
string[8:12]
```

Will output:  
```
'ith '
```
</details><p></p>

**Stride**  
Stride values can be found using by indicating a step after the slice (with or without selecting the starting index and length)


|S |t |r |i |n |g |  |w |i |t |h |  |a |  |3 |  |i |n |  |i |t |! |  
|- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |  
|0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 |10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|  

<details><summary>Select every second element</summary>

```py
string[::2]
```

Will output:  
```
'Srn iha3i t'
```
</details><p></p>

Slicing can also be incorporated with stride for example, select the first five elements and then use the stride:
<details><summary>Select every second element in the range from index 0 to index 4</summary>

```py
string[0:5:2]
```

Will output:  
```
'Srn'
```
</details><p></p>

**Concatenate Strings**  

Two or more strings can be concatenated by using the addition symbol, the result is a new string that is a combination of strings.
<details><summary>Concatenate two strings</summary>

```py
string = "String with a 3 in it!"
new_string = string + " With this too."
```

Will output:  
```
'String with a 3 in it! With this too.'
```
</details><p></p>

String values can also be replicated by multiplying the variable or string by the number of times it should be replicated.
<details><summary>Print the string for 3 times</summary>

```py
3 * string
```

Will output:  
```
'String with a 3 in it!String with a 3 in it!String with a 3 in it!'
```
</details><p></p>

A new string can be created by setting it to the original variable, concatenated  with a new string.
<details><summary>Replace string with concatenation</summary>

```py
string = string + " With this too."
print(string)
```

Will output:  
```
'String with a 3 in it! With this too.'
```
</details><p></p>

___
### Escape Sequences
Back slashes represent the beginning  of escape sequences. Escape sequences represent strings that may be difficult to input. For example, `\n` represents a new line. The output is given by a new line after the `\n` is encountered.
<details><summary>New line escape sequence</summary>

```py
print("String\nwith a 3 in it!")
```

Will output:  
```
String
with a 3 in it!
```
</details><p></p>

Similarly, back slash  "t" represents a tab:
<details><summary>Tab escape sequence</summary>

```py
print("String\twith a 3 in it!")
```

Will output:  
```
String  with a 3 in it!
```
</details><p></p>

To place a back slash in a string, a double backslash is used, or an `r`can be placed before the string:  
<details><summary>Include back slash in string</summary>

```py
print("String \\ with a 3 in it!")
# Or
print(r"String \ with a 3 in it!")
```

Will output:  
```
String \ with a 3 in it!
```
</details><p></p>

### String Operations
There are many string operation methods in Python that can be used to manipulate data. Some basic string operations include:

<details><summary>Upper()</summary>

```py
# Convert all the characters in string to upper case
a = "String with a 3 in it!"
print("before upper:", a)
b = a.upper()
print("After upper:", b)
```

Will output:  
```
before upper: String with a 3 in it!
After upper: STRING WITH A 3 IN IT!
```
</details><p></p>

<details><summary>Lower()</summary>

```py
# Convert all the characters in string to upper case
a = "STRING WITH A 3 IN IT!"
print("before lower:", a)
b = a.lower()
print("After lower:", b)
```

Will output:  
```
before lower: STRING WITH A 3 IN IT!
After lower: string with a 3 in it!
```
</details><p></p>

<details><summary>Replace()</summary>

The method `replace` replaces a segment of a string; i.e. a substring  with a new string. The first argument represents the substring to be repaced, the second argument is the substring it is to be replaced with. The result is a new string with the segment changed.

```py
# Replace the word 'string' with 'biskit'
a = "String with a 3 in it!"
b = a.replace('String', 'Biskit')
print(b)
```

Will output:  
```
'Biskit with a 3 in it!'
```

Similarly:
```py
# Replace the old substring with the new target substring by removing some punctuations.
a = "String, with a 3. in it!"
print(a)
b = a.replace('!','').replace(',','').replace('.','')
print(b)
```

Will output:  
```
String, with a 3. in it!
String with a 3 in it
```
</details><p></p>

<details><summary>Find()</summary>

The method `find()` finds a sub-string. The argument is the substring you would like to find, and the output is the first index of the sequence. We can find the sub-string `with` or `i`.

|S |t |r |i |n |g |  |w |i |t |h |  |a |  |3 |  |i |n |  |i |t |! |  
|- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |  
|0 |1 |2 |3 |4 |5 |6 |7 |8 |9 |10|11|12|13|14|15|16|17|18|19|20|21|  

```py
# Find the substring in the string. Only the index of the first elment of substring in string will be the output
string = "String with a 3 in it!"
string.find('with')

# Find the substring in the string.
string.find('i')
```

Will output:  
```
7
3
```

If the  sub-string is not in the string then the output is a negative one. For example, the string `'Jasd'` is not a substring:
```py
string = "String with a 3 in it!"
string.find('Jasd')
```

Will output:  
```
-1
```
</details><p></p>

### RegEx
In Python, RegEx (Regular Expression) is a tool for matching and manipulating strings. Python provides a built-in module called `re`, which allows working with regular expressions. 

The RegEx module provides several functions for working with regular expressions, including `search`, `split`, `findall`, and `sub`. 

There are several special sequences in RegEx that can be used to match specific characters or patterns.

|Special Sequence| Meaning                                                              | 	Example                                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| \d             |Matches any digit character (0-9)                                     |"123" matches "\d\d\d"                             |
|\D              |Matches any non-digit character                                       |"hello" matches "\D\D\D\D\D"                       |
|\w              |Matches any word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and _)                     |"hello_world" matches "\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w\w"     |
|\W              |Matches any non-word character                                        |"@#$%" matches "\W\W\W\W"                          |
|\s              |Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, etc.)          |"hello world" matches "\w\w\w\w\w\s\w\w\w\w\w"     |
|\S              |Matches any non-whitespace character                                  |"hello_world" matches "\S\S\S\S\S\S\S\S\S"         |
|\b              |Matches the boundary between a word character and a non-word character|"cat" matches "\bcat\b" in "The cat sat on the mat"|
|\B              |Matches any position that is not a word boundary                      |"cat" matches "\Bcat\B" in "category" but not in "The cat sat on the mat"|


**Special Sequence Examples:**

A simple example of using the `\d` special sequence in a regular expression pattern with Python code.  
The regular expression pattern is defined as r"\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d", which uses the \d special sequence to match any digit character (0-9), and the \d sequence is repeated ten times to match ten consecutive digits:

```py
import re
pattern = r"\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d\d"  # Matches any ten consecutive digits
text = "My Phone number is 1234567890"
match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("Phone number found:", match.group())
else:
    print("No match")
```

Will output:  
```
Phone number found: 1234567890
```

A simple example of using the `\W` special sequence to match any character that is *not* a word character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or _). The string we're searching for matches in is "Hello, world!".
```py
pattern = r"\W"  # Matches any non-word character
text = "Hello, world!"
matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print("Matches:", matches)
```

Will output:  
```
Matches: [',', ' ', '!']
```

<details><summary>Search()</summary>

The `search()` function searches for specified patterns within a string. Here is an example that explains how to use the `search()` function to search for the word `"with"` in the string `"String with a 3 in it!"`.
```py
string = "String with a 3 in it!"

# Define the pattern to search for
pattern = r"with"

# Use the search() function to search for the pattern in the string
result = re.search(pattern, string)

# Check if a match was found
if result:
    print("Match found!")
else:
    print("Match not found.")
```

Will output:  
```
Match found!
```

</details><p></p>

<details><summary>Findall()</summary>

The `findall()` function finds all occurrences of a specified pattern within a string.
```py
string = "String with some threes and also a biskit in it!"

# Use the findall() function to find all occurrences of the "it" in the string
result = re.findall("it", string)

# Print out the list of matched words
print(result)
```

Will output:  
```
['it', 'it', 'it']
```

</details><p></p>


<details><summary>Split()</summary>

The method `split()` splits the string at the specified separator, and returns a list
```py
#Split the substring into list
string = "String with a 3 in it!"
split_string = (string.split())
 print(split_string)
```

Will output:  
```
['String', 'with', 'a', '3', 'in', 'it!']
```

A regular expression's `split()` function splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified pattern.
```py
# Use the split function to split the string by the "\s" (Whitespace)
split_array = re.split("\s", string)

# The split_array contains all the substrings, split by whitespace characters
print(split_array)
```

Will output:  
```
['String', 'with', 'a', '3', 'in', 'it!']
```

</details><p></p>


<details><summary>Sub()</summary>

The `sub()` function of a regular expression in Python is used to replace all occurrences of a pattern in a string with a specified replacement.
```py
string = "String with a 3 in it!"

# Define the regular expression pattern to search for
pattern = "String"

# Define the replacement string
replacement = "Biskit"

# Use the sub function to replace the pattern with the replacement string
new_string = re.sub(pattern, replacement, string, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

# The new_string contains the original string with the pattern replaced by the replacement string
print(new_string) 
```

Will output:  
```
Biskit with a 3 in it!
```

While performing similar tasks, `sub()` Supports regular expressions, allowing for complex pattern matching, it can match and replace based on patterns like character classes, repetitions, and groupings it also allows the use of backreferences and can handle more complex replacements.

While more powerful and flexible than `replace()`, the `sub()` method is slower and has higher resource overheads; so for simple find and replace tasks `replace()` may be the better option.
