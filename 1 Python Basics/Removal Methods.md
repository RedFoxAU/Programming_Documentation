thank you. I guess I should ask; within python, what other removal methods are there and how do the differ from del?

Great question! Python offers several ways to remove elements or references to data, depending on the context. Here's a breakdown of some common methods and how they differ from del:
1. del Statement

    What It Does: Deletes a reference to an object, or removes an element by key/index.
    Where It's Used:
        Remove dictionary key-value pairs.
        Delete list elements by index.
        Delete entire variables.
    Example:

    # Delete list element by index
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    del my_list[1]  # [1, 3]

    # Delete dictionary entry by key
    my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    del my_dict["b"]  # {"a": 1}

2. remove() Method (Lists Only)

    What It Does: Removes the first occurrence of a specific value from a list.
    Where It's Used: Only for lists.
    Difference from del: remove() operates on values, while del operates on indices.
    Example:

    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2]
    my_list.remove(2)  # Removes the first `2`. Result: [1, 3, 2]

3. pop() Method (Lists and Dictionaries)

    What It Does: Removes and returns an element.
    Where It's Used:
        Remove list elements by index.
        Remove dictionary entries by key.
    Difference from del: pop() gives you the removed value, while del does not.
    Example:

    # Lists
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    value = my_list.pop(1)  # Removes element at index 1. Result: [1, 3], value = 2

    # Dictionaries
    my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    value = my_dict.pop("b")  # Removes key 'b'. Result: {"a": 1}, value = 2

4. clear() Method (Lists and Dictionaries)

    What It Does: Removes all elements, leaving the container empty.
    Where It's Used: Lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.
    Difference from del: clear() empties the container but keeps the variable intact.
    Example:

    # Lists
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    my_list.clear()  # Result: []

    # Dictionaries
    my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    my_dict.clear()  # Result: {}

5. discard() Method (Sets Only)

    What It Does: Removes a value from a set. If the value doesn't exist, it does nothing (no error).
    Where It's Used: Only for sets.
    Difference from del: discard() is specific to sets and is non-error-throwing.
    Example:

    my_set = {1, 2, 3}
    my_set.discard(2)  # Result: {1, 3}
    my_set.discard(4)  # No error, set remains unchanged.

6. pop() Method (Sets Only)

    What It Does: Removes and returns an arbitrary element from a set.
    Where It's Used: Only for sets.
    Difference from del: Removes an arbitrary element rather than a specified value.
    Example:

    my_set = {1, 2, 3}
    value = my_set.pop()  # Removes and returns any element (e.g., `1`). Result: {2, 3}

| **Method**      | **Use Case**                       | **Target**               | **Key Difference**                             |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `del`           | Delete references or by key/index | Lists, dicts, variables  | Does not return the deleted value.            |
| `remove()`      | Remove specific value             | Lists only               | Operates on values, not indices.              |
| `pop()`         | Remove and return value           | Lists, dicts, sets       | Returns the removed value.                    |
| `clear()`       | Empty the container               | Lists, dicts, sets       | Keeps the container, empties its contents.    |
| `discard()`     | Remove value (no error)           | Sets only                | Non-error-throwing when value is absent.      |
