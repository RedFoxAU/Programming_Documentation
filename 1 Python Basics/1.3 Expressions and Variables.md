## Variables
*Variables are used to store values.*  

The value `1` can be assigned to the variable `my_variable` using the assignment operator (equals sign)
<details><summary>Assign variable</summary>

```py
my_variable = 1
```
</details><p></p>

Variables can be the result of [expressions](#expressions)
<details><summary>Expression variable</summary>

```py
my_variable = 43 + 60 + 16 + 41
```
</details><p></p>

Operations can be performed on variables the result saved to a new variable
<details><summary>New variable from operation on variable</summary>

```py
# Use another variable to store the result of the operation between variable and value 
y = x / 60
```
</details><p></p>

If a value is saved to an existing variable; the new value will overwrite the previous value
  <details><summary>Overwrite variable</summary>
```py
my_variable = my_variable / 60
print(my_variable)
```
</details><p></p>

*It's good practice to use meaningful variable names, to improve code readability and maintainability*

___
### Variables from user input
Variables can be derived from a user input. All variables can then be used elsewhere by recalling the (exact) name of the variable
<details><summary>request and print variable from user input</summary>

```py
# Request User input
name = input("Hi, What's your name? ")

# Recall the variable
print ("Hi",name,"it's nice to meet you, I hope you're having a nice day :)")
```
[Code](<../XXCode Snips/1.3.1 Variables from user input.py>)
</details><p></p>

Will output:  
```
Hi, What's your name? Amanda
Hi Amanda it's nice to meet you, I hope you're having a nice day :)
```

*In Python, variables derived from the `input()` function are treated as a string by default.*  

If comparing a user input variable to numerical values, the input must be converted to an integer using the `int()` function. See [Type Casting](1.2%20Types.md#advanced-type-casting) for more information.  
 
<details><summary><i>See below for an illustration of what happens if input variables are not correctly converted</i></summary>

Script to return an answer depending on a user's input:  

**Incorrect:**
```py
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```
In this case, age is a string. When attempting to compare it with integers using  the `<=` operator, Python throws an error.

To fix this, `age` must be converted to an integer:  
**Correct**  
```py
# Request user input and onvert to integer
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```

This ensures that age is treated as an integer, allowing numerical comparisons without raising a `TypeError`.

## Expressions  
*Expressions describe a type of operation that computers perform.*  

Expressions in Python can include operations among compatible types (e.g. integers and floats). For example, basic arithmetic operations  
<details><summary>Addition operation expression</summary>

`43 + 60 + 16 + 41`  
</details>

<details><summary>Subtraction operation expression</summary>
 
`50 - 60`  
</details>

<details><summary>Multiplication operation expression</summary>

`5 * 5`  
</details>

<details><summary>Division operation expression</summary>

`25 / 5`  
</details><p></p>

We can use the double slash for integer division, where the result is rounded down to the nearest integer:  
<details><summary>Integer division operation expression</summary>

`25 // 4`  
</details><p></p>

Python follows mathematical conventions when performing mathematical expressions (*BODMAS*).  

___
### Modulo  
The `%` operator in Python is called the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. For example `3 % 2` will return "1".

A common context in which this is used is checking for odd or even numbers, the modulo operator is used to check if a number is divisible by 2.
<details><summary>Use modulo to test odd or even</summary>

```py
if number % 2 != 0: # Will return True if the number is odd
```
</details><p></p>

[Code](<../XXCode Snips/1.3.3 Even or Odd.py>)  
*See [Loops *Needs update 3.2](/3%20Control%20Flow/3.2%20Loops.md) for loop information.*

## Advanced Removal Methods in Python Collections
Python offers several ways to remove elements or references to data, depending on the context. These include:

| **Method**           | **Use Case**                                 | **Target** | **Key Difference**                                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `del`                | Delete references or by key/index            | L, T, D    | Deletes references, including entire variables, tuples, or dictionary entries without returning the deleted value. |
| `remove()`           | Remove specific value                        | L, S       | Removes the first occurrence of a specific value, throws an error if absent.    |
| `pop()`              | Remove and return value                      | L, S, D    | Removes and returns the value. For dictionaries, removes by key, returning the value.                               |
| `clear()`            | Empty the container                          | L, S, D    | Empties the container but keeps the container intact (canâ€™t be used on tuples). |
| `discard()`          | Remove value (no error if absent)            | S          | Does not raise an error if the value is absent.                                 |
| `difference_update()`| Remove elements found in another iterable    | S          | Removes all elements found in another iterable, modifies the set in place.      |
| `tuple slicing`      | Create a new tuple without specific elements | T          | Used to 'remove' elements by creating a new tuple. Tuples are immutable, so slicing produces a modified version. |

**KEY:**
- **L**: Lists
- **T**: Tuples
- **S**: Sets
- **D**: Dictionaries

### del Statement
The `del` statement can be used with [lists](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#delete), [dictionaries](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.3%20Dictionaries.md#delete) and entire variables. While it cannot delete elements from a [tuple](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#concatenation-and-immutability) because tuples are immutabe, it can be used to remove an entire tuple. Delete (unlinke remove) does not return the deleted value.   
The `del` statement deletes a reference to an object, or the reference to the element specified by key/index. if no references remain the object/element is garbage collected.  

___
### remove() Method
The `remove()` method is used specifically on [lists](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#remove), it removes the first occurrence of a specific value from a list. Being a method, `remove()` operates on values in place.  
The `remove()` method will also work on [sets](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.2%20Sets.md#remove), however it's limitation of only removing a single value at a time, and the fact that it will throw a `KeyError` if a value isn't present in the set makes it less preferred.

___
### pop() Method
The `pop()` method is similar to `del()` in that it will remove an element referred to by index/key from a [list](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#pop) or [dictionary](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.3%20Dictionaries.md#pop), however it will also return the removed element. `pop()` will also remove elements from [sets](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.2%20Sets.md#pop); because sets are unordered and do not hae indexes or keys the removed element will be seemingly random, but the element is still returned.

___
### clear() Method
The `clear()` method will remove all elements of a [list](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#clear), [set](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.2%20Sets.md#clear) or [dictionary](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.3%20Dictionaries.md#clear), leaving the container empty without removing it. Unlike `del()` it will empty the container but leave the variable intact. `clear()` will not work with tuples as they are immutable.

### discard() Method
The `discard()` method is unique to [sets](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.2%20Sets.md#discard). It does much the same as `remove()` except that if the item to be removed does not exist in the set, `discard()` will handle it silently.

___
### difference_update() Method
The `difference_update()` method is unique to [sets](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.2%20Sets.md#difference-update). It will remove multiple elements at once. Alternatively the subtraction operator `-` can be used. Note that `difference_update()` modifies the set in place, whereas subtraction creates a new set. 

___
### Tuple Slicing
While [tuple slicing](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#slicing) is not strictly a removal method, it is a means of 'removing' values from tuples (which are [immutable](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#concatenation-and-immutability)) by taking the parts of a tuple that are to be kept and creating a new tuple (as well as allowing items to be 'added' to the new tuple.)

# Request input
temp = input ("What is the Celsius temperature that you would like to convert to Fahrenheit? ")

# Convert input temp to float
float_temp = float(temp)

# Convert the temp into farenheight
farenheit = (9/5) * float_temp + 32
