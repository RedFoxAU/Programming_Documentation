**Types**

*A type is how Python represents different types of data.*

Python is an object-oriented language. There are many different types of objects in Python, some of the most common objects are integers (`int`), strings (`str`) floats (`float`) and boolean (`bool`). The data type in Python can be determined using the type command. For example:
```python
type(38)
type(1.6)
type("Catepillar")
type(True)
```

Will render:
```
class 'int'
class 'float'
class 'str'
class 'bool'
```

* Integers: The set of real numbers with no decimal or fraction; -1, 2, 1000 etc
* Floats: Numbers that contain a decimal; 1.5, 3.14, 166.456 etc
* Strings: A Sequence of characters that can include letters, numbers or symbols; "This is a sring, 33 !"
* Boolean: A data type that can only have one of two possible values, most commonly True/False (Note: case is important)

There are some limitations when it comes to machines representing real numbers, but floating point numbers are a good representation in most cases. The specifics of floats for a given runtime environment can be checked using `sys.float_info`. This will also show the largest and smallest number that can be represented with them (*Note: `sys` must be imported first*).

### Type Casting
Expression types can be changed in python, this is called type casting. the integer 2 can be cast to a float as follows:
```python
float(2)
```
Which will render:
```
2.0
```
Note that when casting a float to an integer, information can be lost; for example casting 1.1 to an integer will result in 1.

If a string contains an integer value, it can be converted to a float or int; however this is only possible if the string contains only numerical characters; for example
```python
int('1')
float('1.2')
```
Will render:
```
1
1.2
```

While `int(1 and some text)` would result in an error.

Boolean can be cast o an integer or float; If a Boolean True is cast to an integer or float it will result in `1` or `1.0`. Simialarly to an integer or
float, we will get a 1. If we cast a Boolean false to an integer or
float, we get a zero. If you cast a 1 to a Boolean, you get a true.
Similarly, if you cast a 0 to a Boolean, you get a false.
Check the labs for more examples or check Python.org for other kinds of types in Python.*

### Advanced Type Casting
There are more advanced ways to do type-casting, for example, taking an [input](/ "Needs doing") (which is aways a string), and casting it to an integer; however the input type must be explained and [error handling](/ "Needs doing") is a very good idea.  
For example:
```py
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```
