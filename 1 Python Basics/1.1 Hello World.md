### Hello World
*Typically the first program that will be created*  

A statement or expression is an instruction the computer will run or execute. Perhaps the simplest program that can be written is a print statement. When a print statement is run, Python will display the argument (the value in the parentheses). 
<details><summary>Hello World</summary>

```python
# Ye Olde Hello World
print ("Hello World")
```
</details>

Will output:  
```
`Hello World`  
```
[Code](<..\Code Snips\1.1.1 Hello World.py>)

Note it is good practice to comment code:

<details><summary>Code Comments</summary>

```python

# This is a single-line comment
"""
This is a 
multi-line comment
"""
```
</details>

### Print Formatting
Printing on multiple lines:

<details><summary>Multi-Line Printing</summary>

```python
# Ye Olde Hello World
print ("Hello\nWorld")
```
</details>

Will output:  
```
Hello 
World
```
___
### F-strings and printing variables
Variables can be included in print statements as follows:

<details><summary>Variable Printing</summary>

```python
# Define variable
num = 3

# Print with a variable
print ("Hello World", num)
```
</details>

Will output:  
```
Hello World 3
```
*(See [Types](<1.2 Types.md>) for more information about variables and strings. )*

This can be done more elegantly with f-strings which caninterpolate variables, objects, and expressions directly into strings. It also allows better control over spacing.

By prefixing a string with f or F, expressions can be embedded within curly braces ({}), which are evaluated at runtime.

<details><summary>f-string Printing</summary>

```python
# Variables
name = "Bob"
age = 30

# Print with f-strings
print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.")
```
</details>

Will output:  
``` 
Hello, my name is Bob and I'm 30 years old.
```
