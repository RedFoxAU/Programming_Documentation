## Exception Handling

An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of code. This error causes the code to raise an exception and if not prepared to handle it will halt the execution of the code.

*A summary of common error types and their causes:*
| Error Type         | Description                                              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `SyntaxError`      | Code violates Python syntax rules.                       |
| `IndentationError` | Incorrect or inconsistent indentation.                   |
| `NameError`        | Variable or function name not defined.                   |
| `TypeError`        | Operation used with an incompatible type.                |
| `ValueError`       | Function receives an argument of the correct type but invalid value.|
| `KeyError`         | Dictionary key not found.                                |
| `IndexError`       | List or tuple index out of range.                        |
| `AttributeError`   | Attribute or method not found for an object.             |
| `ImportError`      | Module not found or failed to import.                    |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Specific subclass of `ImportError` for missing modules.|
| `ZeroDivisionError`| Division by zero attempted.                              |
| `FileNotFoundError`| File or directory not found.                             |
| `IOError`          | General input/output operation failure. Largely replaced by `OSError` in modern Python.|
| `RuntimeError`     | Generic error raised during runtime.                     |
| `OverflowError`    | Numeric calculation exceeds maximum limit.               |
| `MemoryError`      | Memory allocation failed.                                |
| `AssertionError`   | `assert` statement fails.                                |

Exception handling is the anticipation of errors and implementing code to handle likely ones. 

### Try Except

`try except` will allow code to be run that may raise an exception, in the case of either any exception, or a specific one, the exception can be handled or caught, and specific code executed. This means that a program will continue to be executed  even if there is an exception.  

Python tries to execute the code in the `try` block. In this case if there is any exception raised by the code in the `try` block, it will be caught and the code in the `except` block will be executed. After that, the code that comes after the try except will be executed.

The basic structure is shown below:
``py
# potential code before try catch

try:
    # code to try to execute
except:
    # code to execute if there is an exception
    pass # Placeholder for future implementation

# code that will still execute provided the code does not exit or halt if there is an exception
```

In the basic example below, the code attempts to divide "1" by a user input number. if the user input is invalid, for example a non-integer, or zero, the code will exit gracefully with an error message.

*Try Except Example*
``py
a = 1

try:
    b = int(input("Please enter a number to divide a: "))
    a = a/b
    print("Success 1/", b ,"=",a)
except:
    print("There was an error")
```

### Try Except Specific

A specific `try except` allows the catching of certain exceptions and  the execution of certain code depending on the exception. This is useful if it is not necessary to deal with some exceptions and the execution should halt. It can also be useful to find errors in code that might not be apparent. Furthermore, it can help differentiate responses to different exceptions. In this case, the code after the try except might not run depending on the error.

The basic structure is shown below, including an empty `except` at the end to catch an unexpected exception:
``py
# potential code before try catch

try:
    # code to try to execute
except (ZeroDivisionError, NameError):
    # code to execute if there is an exception of the given types
except ValueError:
    # code to execute if there is a ValueError
except:
    # code to execute if there is any exception
    
# code that will execute if there is no exception or a one that we are handling
```

*Try Except Specific Example*
``py
a = 1

try:
    b = int(input("Please enter a number to divide a: "))
    a = a/b
    print("Success 1/", b ,"=",a)
except (ZeroDivisionError):
    print("The number you provided cant divide 1 because it is 0")
except ValueError:
    print("You did not provide a number")
except:
    print("Something went wrong")
```

### Try Except Else and Finally

`else` allows one to check if there was no exception when executing the try block. This is useful when it is necessary to execute something only if there were no errors.

`finally` allows us to always execute something even if there is an exception or not. This is usually used to signify the end of the try except.
``py
# potential code before try catch

try:
    # code to try to execute
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # code to execute if there is a ZeroDivisionError
except NameError:
    # code to execute if there is a NameError
except:
    # code to execute if ther is any exception
else:
    # code to execute if there is no exception
finally:
    # code to execute at the end of the try except no matter what
    
# code that will execute if there is no exception or a one that we are handling
```

*Try Except Else and Finally Example*
``py
a = 1

try:
    b = int(input("Please enter a number to divide a: "))
    a = a/b
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("The number you provided cant divide 1 because it is 0")
except ValueError:
    print("You did not provide a number")
except:
    print("Something went wrong")
else:
    print("Success 1/", b ,"=",a)
finally:
    print("Processing Complete")
```

### Custom Exception Classes
In Python, custom exception classes can be created by inheriting from Exception. 
``py
class MyError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for specific errors."""
    pass

# Example of raising the custom exception
def risky_function(value):
    if value < 0:
        raise MyError("Negative values are not allowed!")

try:
    risky_function(-1)
except MyError as e:
    print(f"Caught an error: {e}")
```

The MyError class doesn't add any functionality beyond Exception, however it allows the raising and catching of specific errors related to an application.  

___
### Logging Exceptions
For production code, it's better to use logging instead of `print()` to record exceptions, as logging provides more control and allows saving logs to a file.
``py
import logging

logging.basicConfig(filename='app.log', level=logging.ERROR)

try:
    risky_function(-1)
except MyError as e:
    logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

This logs the error message into app.log, making debugging easier without cluttering the console.

## Exception Handling Exercises

**Exercise 1:**  

*Handling ZeroDivisionError*

There are two numbers, one is to be divided by the other. Create a function called `safe_divide` which will accept two numbers; `numerator` and `denominator`, use the Python `input()` method to take the values.

The function should perform the divisionand return the result, but should return `None` rather than an error if dividing by zero is attempted. Rather is should print `Error: Cannot divide by Zero.`  

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```py
import sys

def safe_divide(n,d):
    try:
        print(f"{n}/{d} = {n/d}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number: ")
        sys.exit(1)
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by Zero!")
        d = int(input("Please enter another number: "))
        safe_divide(n,d)
    except:
        print("Something went wrong")
        sys.exit(1)

n = int(input("Please enter a numerator: "))
d = int(input("Please enter a denominator: "))
safe_divide(n,d)

### Does not actually handle ValueError because n/d are cast to ints outide the function. To actually use the `sys.exit(1)` cast to ints before trying the division; or the better option, make a `get_valid_integer()` function.
```

Will output:
```
Please enter a numerator: 7
Please enter a denominator: 0
Error: Cannot divide by Zero!
Please enter another number: 5s
7/5 = 1.4
```

**Exercise 2:**

*Handling ValueError*

Calculate the square root of a number; to do this create a Python function. Give this function one number, `'number1'`.

The function should generate the square root value if provided a positive integer or float value as input. However, the function should detect the mistake if a negative value is entered and provide a message saying, `'Invalid input! Please enter a positive integer or a float value.`

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

``py
import math

def perform_calculation(number1):
    try:
        result = math.sqrt(number1)
        print(f"Result: {result}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Error: Invalid input! Please enter a positive integer or a float value.")
# Test case
number1=float(input("Enter the number:-"))
perform_calculation(number1)
```

</details>

**Exercise 3:**

*Handling Generic Exceptions*

Perform a calculation dividing the value of an input argument `"num"` by the difference between `"num"` and 5. The result should be stored in a variable called `"result"`.

Define a function so that it can perform the task, the function should handle any potential errors that occur during the calculation. Use a try-except block to do this. any exceptions should be caught using the generic exception class `"Exception" as "e"`. When an exception occurs, the function should display `"An error occurred during calculation.`

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

``py
def complex_calculation(num):
    try:
        result = num / (num - 5)
        print (f"Result: {result}")
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred during calculation.")
# Test case
user_input = float(input("Enter a number: "))
complex_calculation(user_input)
```
