## Reading Files
One way to read or write a file in Python is to use the built-in `open` function. The `open` function provides a **File object** that contains the methods and attributes you need in order to read, save, and manipulate the file.  

The first parameter you need is the file path and the file name. The mode argument is optional and the default value is **r**.
* **r**: Read mode for reading files
* **w**: Write mode for writing files

```py
#File object               File Name
#____                    ___________________
 file = open("/Resources/fileToBeHandled.txt" ,"r")
#             _________                        ___
#             File Path                        Mode
```

For the following examples this [file](/Resources/fileToBeHandled.txt) will be used.

Below are common commands used to open a file and view various attributes:
```py
# Read fileToBeHandled.txt
example1 = "fileToBeHandled.txt"
file1 = open(example1, "r")
 
# Print the path of file
print(file1.name)
 
# Print the mode of file, either 'r' or 'w'
print(file1.mode)

# We can read the file and assign it to a variable
FileContent = file1.read()
 
# Print the file using the new variable
print(FileContent)

# Find the type of file content
print(type(FileContent))

# Close file after finish
file1.close()
```

Will output:
```
fileToBeHandled.txt
r
The first line of text.1213
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
<class 'str'>
```

It is important to close files when they are no longer in use, this frees up resources and ensures consistency across different python versions.

___
### Reading With with open()
It is better practice to Read files using the `with` statement, it automatically closes the file even if the code encounters an exception. The code will run everything in the indent block then close the file object.

```py
# Open file using with
with open("fileToBeHandled.txt", "r") as file1:
    FileContent = file1.read()
    print(FileContent)

# Verify that the file is closed
print(file1.closed)
```

Will output:
```
The first line of text.1213
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
True
```

### Reading Partial File Content
It is not necessary to read an entire file, instead certain characters or lines can be selected by adding them as parameters to the `.read()` method. Calling the read method multiple times will read from the last point.

```py
# Read certain amount of characters
with open("fileToBeHandled.txt", "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(7))
    print(file1.read(15))
```

Will output:
```
The 
firs
t line
of text.1213
```

the `readline()` method works similarly but will read each line, or read a specifed line. Unlike ` read()`, ` readline()` can only read one line at most.
```py
# Read one line
with open("fileToBeHandled.txt", "r") as file1:
    print("first line: " + file1.readline())
    print(file1.readline(3)) # does not read past the end of line
    print(file1.read(5)) # Returns the next 20 chars
```

Will output:
```
first line: The first line of text.1213

Lin
e 2
L
```
### Read Lines With Loop
[Loops](/3%20Flow%20Control/3.2%20Loops.md) can be used to loop through a file and read each line.
```py
# Iterate through the lines
with open("fileToBeHandled.txt", "r") as file1:
        i = 0;
        for line in file1:
            print("Iteration", str(i), ": ", line)
            i = i + 1
```

Will output:
```
Iteration 0 :  The first line of text.1213

Iteration 1 :  Line 2

Iteration 2 :  Line 3

Iteration 3 :  Line 4
```

The method `readlines()` can be used to save the text file to a list. Each element of the list corresponds to a line of text.
```py
# Read all lines and save as a list
with open("fileToBeHandled.txt", "r") as file1:
    FileasList = file1.readlines()

# Print the first line
FileasList[0]

# Print the second line
FileasList[1]

# Print the third line
FileasList[2]
```

Will output:
```
The first line of text.1213

Line 2

Line 3

```

## File Reading Exercises

**Exercise 1:**  

Write a script that reads the contents of a text file, counts the occurrences of each word, and prints the word frequencies. You can use the text of a short story or any text file for testing.

```py
import re

with open ("fileToBeHandled.txt") as file:
    new = (file.split(" "))
    for i in new:
        count = re.findall(r"i", file)
        print(f"Word: {i}, Count: {count}

```

Will output:
```
