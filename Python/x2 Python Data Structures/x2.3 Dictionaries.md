### 2.3 **Dictionaries**

*Let�s cover dictionaries in Python. Dictionaries are a type of collection in Python.
If you recall, a list has integer indexes. These are like addresses.
A list also has elements. A dictionary has keys and values.
The key is analogous to the index, they are like addresses but they don�t have to be
integers. They are usually characters; the values are
similar to the elements in a list and contain information.
To create a dictionary, we use curly brackets. The keys are the first elements; they must
be immutable and unique. Each key is followed by a value separated
by a colon. The values can be immutable, mutable and duplicates.
Each key and value pair is separated by a comma.
Consider the following example of a dictionary, the album title is the key and the value is
the release data. We can use yellow to highlight the keys and
leave the values in white. It is helpful to use the table to visualize
a dictionary, where the first column represents the keys and the second column represents
the values. We can add a few more examples to the dictionary.
We can also assign the dictionary to a variable. The key is used to look up the value. We use
square brackets; the argument is the key. This outputs the value.
Using the key of "Back in Black," this returns the value of 1980.
The key "The Dark Side of the Moon," gives us the value of 1973.
Using the Key "The Bodyguard," gives us the value 1992, and so on.
We can add a new entry to the dictionary as follows.
This will add the value 2007 with the new key called "Graduation."
We can delete an entry as follows. This gets rid of the key "Thriller" and its
value. We can verify if an element is in the dictionary
using the in command as follows. The command checks the keys. If they are in
the dictionary, they return a true. If we try the same command with a key that
is not in the dictionary, we get a false. If we try with another key that is not in
the dictionary, we get a false. In order to see all the keys in a dictionary,
we can use the method keys to get the keys. The output is a list like object with all
the keys. In the same way, we can obtain the values
using the method values. Check out the labs for more examples and info
on dictionaries.*

<h3 id="content">What are Dictionaries?</h3>

A dictionary consists of keys and values. It is helpful to compare a dictionary to a list. Instead of being indexed numerically like a list, dictionaries have keys. These keys are the keys that are used to access values within a dictionary.

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/DictsList.png" width="650">

An example of a Dictionary <code>Dict</code>:

# Create the dictionary

Dict = {"key1": 1, "key2": "2", "key3": [3, 3, 3], "key4": (4, 4, 4), ('key5'): 5, (0, 1): 6}
Dict
* <u>"key1": 1</u>- The key is a string "key1", and its corresponding value is the integer 1.

* <u>"key2": "2"</u> - The key is a string "key2", and its corresponding value is the string "2".

* <u>"key3": [3, 3, 3]</u> - The key is a string "key3", and its corresponding value is a list [3, 3, 3]. The list contains three elements, all of which are integer 3.

* <u>"key4": (4, 4, 4)</u> - The key is a string "key4", and its corresponding value is a tuple (4, 4, 4). The tuple contains three elements, all of which are the integer 4.

* <u>('key5'): 5</u> - The key is a tuple ('key5',), and its corresponding value is the integer 5. Note that the key is enclosed in parentheses to indicate it as a tuple. In this case, the tuple contains a single element: the string "key5".

* <u>(0, 1): 6</u> - The key is a tuple (0, 1), and its corresponding value is the integer 6. This tuple contains two elements: 0 and 1.

The keys can be strings:

# Access to the value by the key

Dict["key1"]
Keys can also be any immutable object such as a tuple: 

# Access to the value by the key

Dict[(0, 1)]
 Each key is separated from its value by a colon "<code>:</code>".  Commas separate the items, and the whole dictionary is enclosed in curly braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this  "<code>{}</code>".

# Create a sample dictionary

release_year_dict = {"Thriller": "1982", "Back in Black": "1980", \
                    "The Dark Side of the Moon": "1973", "The Bodyguard": "1992", \
                    "Bat Out of Hell": "1977", "Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975)": "1976", \
                    "Saturday Night Fever": "1977", "Rumours": "1977"}
release_year_dict
In summary, like a list, a dictionary holds a sequence of elements. Each element is represented by a key and its corresponding value. Dictionaries are created with two curly braces containing keys and values separated by a colon. For every key, there can only be one single value, however,  multiple keys can hold the same value. Keys can only be strings, numbers, or tuples, but values can be any data type.

It is helpful to visualize the dictionary as a table, as in the following image. The first column represents the keys, the second column represents the values.

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/DictsStructure.png" width="650">

<h3 id="key">Keys</h3>

You can retrieve the values based on the names:

# Get value by keys

release_year_dict['Thriller'] 
This corresponds to: 

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/DictsKeyOne.png" width="500">

Similarly for <b>The Bodyguard</b>

# Get value by key

release_year_dict['The Bodyguard'] 
<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/DictsKeyTwo.png" width="500">

Now let us retrieve the keys of the dictionary using the method <code>keys()</code>:

# Get all the keys in dictionary

release_year_dict.keys() 
You can retrieve the values using the method  <code>values()</code>:

# Get all the values in dictionary

release_year_dict.values() 
We can add an entry:

# Append value with key into dictionary

release_year_dict['Graduation'] = '2007'
release_year_dict
We can delete an entry:   

# Delete entries by key

del(release_year_dict['Thriller'])
del(release_year_dict['Graduation'])
release_year_dict
 We can verify if an element is in the dictionary: 

# Verify the key is in the dictionary

'The Bodyguard' in release_year_dict
