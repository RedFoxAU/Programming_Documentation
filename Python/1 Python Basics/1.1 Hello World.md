### Hello World
*Typically the first program that will be created*  

A statement or expression is an instruction the computer will run or execute. Perhaps the simplest program that can be written is a print statement. When a print statement is run, Python will display the argument (the value in the parentheses). Note it is good practice to comment code.

```python
# Ye Olde Hello World
print ("Hello World")
```
Will output `Hello World`  
[Code](<1.0 Hello World.py>)

### Print Formatting
Printing on multiple lines:

```python
# Ye Olde Hello World
print ("Hello\nWorld")
```
Will output  
```
Hello 
World
```

### F-strings and printing variables
Variables can be included in print statements as follows:
```python
# Define variable
num = 3

# Print with a variable
print ("Hello World", num)
```
Will output `Hello World 3`

This can be done more elegantly with f-strings:
