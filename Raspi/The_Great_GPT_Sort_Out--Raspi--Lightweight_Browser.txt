### Lightweight Browser

What would be a good lightweight web browser for raspi os lite that has adblocking
ChatGPT

For Raspberry Pi OS Lite, a lightweight web browser with adblocking capabilities is ideal due to the limited resources. Here are a few good options:

    Midori:
        Description: Midori is a lightweight, fast web browser that is suitable for systems with limited resources.
        Adblocking: You can enable adblocking by using the built-in functionality or adding extensions.
        Installation:

        bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install midori

Falkon:

    Description: Falkon is a lightweight and fast web browser based on QtWebEngine (the engine behind Chromium).
    Adblocking: It has built-in adblocking capabilities.
    Installation:

    bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install falkon

Dillo:

    Description: Dillo is an extremely lightweight graphical web browser. However, it has limited support for modern web standards.
    Adblocking: Adblocking can be configured through its settings.
    Installation:

    bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install dillo

Lynx (text-based):

    Description: Lynx is a text-based web browser which is extremely lightweight and fast.
    Adblocking: Since it’s text-based, most ads are inherently blocked, but you can also configure it to block more ads.
    Installation:

    bash

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install lynx

For graphical web browsers like Midori and Falkon, you can also enhance their adblocking capabilities by using extensions or adding custom block lists. Lynx is an excellent choice if you only need to access text-based content and want the absolute minimum resource usage.
Which of these will block ads on YouTube? And be the most lightweight?
ChatGPT

Among the browsers mentioned, Falkon would likely be the best option for blocking ads on YouTube while still being relatively lightweight compared to mainstream browsers like Firefox or Chromium. Here’s why Falkon is a good choice:

    Adblocking: Falkon has built-in adblocking capabilities, which can effectively block ads on websites, including YouTube. It uses the same underlying engine (QtWebEngine) as Chromium, so it can handle modern web standards and extensions effectively.

    Lightweight: While Falkon is not as lightweight as text-based browsers like Lynx or graphical browsers like Dillo in terms of resource usage, it is still considered lightweight compared to mainstream browsers. It strikes a good balance between functionality and resource efficiency.

    Ease of Use: Falkon provides a graphical interface similar to other mainstream browsers, making it more user-friendly for those who prefer a familiar browsing experience without sacrificing too much in terms of resource consumption.

    Installation: Falkon can be easily installed on Raspberry Pi OS Lite using the following commands:

    bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install falkon

While Midori is also lightweight and has adblocking capabilities, its development has been less active compared to Falkon, which may affect its ability to effectively block ads on more modern websites like YouTube. Dillo is extremely lightweight but lacks the capability to handle modern web standards and likely won’t support YouTube properly. Lynx, being text-based, doesn’t support multimedia content like YouTube at all.

Therefore, Falkon stands out as a suitable choice for blocking ads on YouTube while maintaining a reasonable level of performance and resource efficiency on Raspberry Pi OS Lite.

Falkon is not listed in the packages, I am installing midori, I don't suppose it has a dark mode?
ChatGPT

Midori, being a lightweight web browser, does not natively support dark mode in its default installation. However, you can achieve a dark mode-like appearance in Midori by using certain themes or custom CSS styles. Here’s how you can enable a dark theme or style in Midori:
Using a Dark GTK Theme

Midori inherits its appearance from your system's GTK theme. If you set a dark GTK theme in your system settings, Midori will follow suit. Here’s how you can do it:

    Install a Dark GTK Theme: Search for and install a dark GTK theme using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu-based systems, you can install a popular dark theme like Adwaita Dark with:

    bash

    sudo apt install adwaita-icon-theme-full

    Change GTK Theme: Once installed, change your system’s GTK theme to the dark variant. You can do this in your system settings under "Appearance" or "Themes".

    Restart Midori: Close and reopen Midori to see it reflect the dark GTK theme.

Using Custom CSS

If you prefer more control over the appearance, you can also apply custom CSS styles to Midori:

    Create a Custom CSS File: Create a CSS file (e.g., midori-dark.css) and add your custom styles. For example:

    css

    body {
        background-color: #1e1e1e;
        color: #ffffff;
    }

    /* Additional styles as per your preference */

    Apply CSS Styles:
        Open Midori.
        Go to Preferences (you may find it under Tools or Edit menu).
        Look for an option to specify a custom stylesheet or user CSS. This varies depending on the version and configuration of Midori.

    Specify the CSS File: Point Midori to your custom CSS file (midori-dark.css).

    Save and Restart: Save your settings and restart Midori for the changes to take effect.

Note:

    Compatibility: The ability to apply custom CSS may vary depending on the version of Midori and the environment (GTK version, desktop environment, etc.).

By using these methods, you can effectively achieve a dark mode or dark theme-like appearance in Midori, enhancing your browsing experience especially in low-light environments.
Given my sound issues with step, I wanted to test whether sound would work with my xterm/openbox setup with a browser playing YouTube. This does work,  which suggests my sound problems are just related to xfreerdp. I have the /sound toggles enabled, what else can I do?
ChatGPT

If you are experiencing sound issues specifically with xfreerdp but other applications (like browsers in an xterm/openbox setup) are able to produce sound correctly, there are several troubleshooting steps you can take to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue:
1. Check xfreerdp Sound Configuration

Make sure that sound redirection is correctly configured in your xfreerdp session settings. Typically, you would use the /sound option to enable sound redirection. Here’s an example command:

bash

xfreerdp /v:<remote_address> /u:<username> /p:<password> /sound /size:<resolution>

Ensure that /sound is included in your command when starting xfreerdp.
2. Verify Remote Sound Settings

Ensure that sound redirection is enabled and correctly configured on the remote Windows machine you are connecting to. Sound redirection settings can sometimes be controlled via group policies or Remote Desktop Session Host Configuration on the Windows server.
3. Check Audio Output Device

Verify that the correct audio output device is selected both on your Raspberry Pi and within the xfreerdp session. Sometimes, the audio output device may need to be explicitly set within the xfreerdp options using the /audio-output parameter.
4. Test with Different Audio Output Options

Try specifying different audio output options within xfreerdp to see if it resolves the issue. For example:

bash

xfreerdp /v:<remote_address> /u:<username> /p:<password> /sound /audio-mode:local

The /audio-mode:local option directs audio output to the local device, which might help if there are issues with the default redirection method.
5. Update xfreerdp and Dependencies

Ensure that xfreerdp and its dependencies are up to date. Sometimes, bugs related to sound redirection are fixed in newer versions of the software.

bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

6. Check PulseAudio Configuration (if applicable)

If your Raspberry Pi uses PulseAudio for sound management, check its configuration and logs for any errors or warnings related to xfreerdp sound redirection. You can check PulseAudio status and logs using commands like:

bash

pulseaudio --check   # Check if PulseAudio is running
pulseaudio --dump-conf   # Dump current PulseAudio configuration
journalctl -u pulseaudio   # View PulseAudio logs

7. Debugging with xfreerdp Logs

Enable verbose logging for xfreerdp to gather more detailed information about what might be going wrong:

bash

xfreerdp /v:<remote_address> /u:<username> /p:<password> /sound /log-level:DEBUG

This will produce more verbose output which may include useful information for diagnosing the sound issue.
8. Check System Sound Settings

Ensure that system-wide sound settings on your Raspberry Pi are configured correctly. Check the volume levels, mute status, and audio output device settings to ensure they are as expected.
9. Test with Different Remote Sessions

If possible, test xfreerdp with different remote Windows machines or different user accounts to see if the issue is specific to a particular setup.
10. Consider Alternative Remote Desktop Clients

If troubleshooting with xfreerdp does not resolve the issue, consider trying alternative Remote Desktop clients such as Remmina, which may have different capabilities or be more compatible with your specific setup.

By following these steps, you should be able to narrow down the cause of the sound issues with xfreerdp and potentially find a solution to get sound working correctly in your remote desktop sessions.
