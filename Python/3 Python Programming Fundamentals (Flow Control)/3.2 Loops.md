### 3.2 **Loops**

6. Loops (for loop):
```python

# Example of for loop
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

*In this video we will cover Loops, in particular �for loops� and �while loops.�
We will use many visual examples in this video. See the labs for examples with data.
Before we talk about loops, let�s go over the range function.
The range function outputs an ordered sequence as a list �i�.
If the input is a positive integer, the output is a sequence; the sequence contains the same
number of elements as the input, but starts at zero.
For example, if the input is 3 the output is the sequence 0,1,2.
If the range function has two inputs where the first input is larger than the second
input, the output is a sequence that starts at the first input.
Then the sequence iterates up to, but not including the second number.
For the input 10 and 15, we get the following sequence. See the labs for more capabilities
of the range function. Please note: if you use Python 3, the range
function will not generate a list explicitly like in Python 2.
In this section, we will cover �for loops�. We will focus on lists, but many of the procedures
can be used on tuples. Loops perform a task over and over.
Consider the group of colored squares. Let's say we would like to replace each colored
square with a white square. Let's give each square a number to make things
a little easier and refer to all the group of squares as squares.
If we wanted to tell someone to replace square 0 with a white square, we would say, �=Replace
square 0 with a white square� or we can say, �For square 0 in squares, square 0=
white square.� Similarly, for the next square, we can say,
�For square 1 in squares, square 1 = white square.�
For the next square, we can say, �For square 2 in squares, square 2= white square.�
We repeat the process for each square. The only thing that changes is the index of
the square we are referring to. If we are going to perform a similar task
in Python, we cannot use actual squares. So let's use a list to represent the boxes.
Each element in the list is a string representing the color.
We want to change the name of the color in each element to white.
Each element in the list has the following index.
This is the syntax to perform a loop in Python. Notice the indent.
The range function generates a list. The code will simply repeat everything in
the indent 5 times. If you were to change the value to 6, it would
do it 6 times, however, the value of �i� is incremented by one each time.
In this segment we change the i-th element of the list to the string white.
The value of �i� is set to zero. Each iteration of the loop starts at the beginning
of the indent. We then run everything in the indent.
The first element in the list is set to white. We then go to the start of the indent.
We progress down each line. When we reach the line to change the value
of the list, we set the value of index 1 to white.
The value of �i� increases by one. We repeat the process for index 2.
The process continues for the next index until we have reached the final element.
We can also iterate through a list or tuple directly in Python, we do not even need to
use indexes. Here is the list squares. Each iteration of
the list we pass one element of the list squares to the variable square.
Let's display the value of the variable square on this section.
For the first iteration, the value of square is red.
We then start the second iteration. For the second iteration, the value of square is yellow.
We then start the third iteration. For the final iteration, the value of square is green.
A useful function for iterating data is enumerate. It can be used to obtain the index and the
element in the list. Let's use the box analogy, with the numbers
representing the index of each square. This is the syntax to iterate through a list
to provide the index of each element. We use the list squares and use the names
of the colors to represent the colored squares. The argument of the function enumerate is
the list, in this case, squares. The variable "i" is the index, and the variable
square is the corresponding element in the list.
Let's use the left part of the screen to display the different values of the variable square,
and "i" for the various iterations of the loop. For the first iteration, the value of the
variable is red, corresponding to the zeroth index, and the value for �i� is zero.
For the second iteration, the value of the variable square is yellow and the value of
"i" corresponds to its index, i.e., 1. We repeat the process for the last index.
�While loops� are similar to �for loops�, but instead of executing a statement a set
number of times, a while loop will only run if a condition is met.
Let�s say we would like to copy all the orange squares from the list squares to the
list new squares, but we would like to stop if we encounter a non-orange square.
We don't know the value of the squares beforehand. We would simply continue the process while
the square is orange, or see if the square equals orange; if not, we would stop.
For the first example, we would check if the square was orange.
It satisfies the condition, so we would copy the square.
We repeat the process for the second square. The condition is met, so we copy the square.
In the next iteration, we encounter a purple square.
The condition is not met so we stop the process. This is essentially what a �while loop�
does. Let's use the figure on the left to represent
the code. We will use a list with the names of the color
to represent the different squares. We create an empty list of �New Squares.�
In reality, the list is of indeterminate size. We start the index at zero.
The �while� statement will repeatedly execute the statements within the indent until
the condition inside the bracket is false. We append the value of the first element of
the list squares to the list "New Squares." We increase the value of �i� by one.
We append the value of the second element of the list squares to the list "New Squares.�
We increment the value of �i�. Now the value in the array �Squares� is
purple. Therefore, the condition for the �while�
statement is false and we exit the loop. Check out the labs for more examples of loop,
many with real data.*

**Task 5: Loops**  
*ChatGPT:*  
Create a script that prints the multiplication table for a given number. Ask the user to input a number, and then use a loop to print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

For example, if the user inputs 5, the script should output:
```
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 3 = 15
...
5 x 10 = 50
```
___

*Me:*  
Id like to come back to that. Before moving on, could you give me a few more tasks similar to task 4 so I can practice memorising the syntax? I'll let you know when I'm ready to continue progressing.  

*ChatGPT:*  
Certainly! Here are a couple more tasks for you to practice:  

*Me:*  
I'm ready to continue with the next level I believe it was loops?  

*ChatGPT:*  
Absolutely! Let's dive into loops. Here's your next task:  
**Task 9: Multiplication Table with a Loop**  
Create a script that takes a user's input for a number and prints the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10, but this time, use a loop to accomplish this.  
For example, if the user enters 7, the script should output:  

```
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
...
7 x 10 = 70
```
Use a loop structure (e.g., for or while) to achieve this repetition.  

*Me:*  
can you give me an example of the basic syntax of a for/while loop (without answering the question)?  

*ChatGPT:*  
Certainly! Here's a basic example of a for loop and a while loop in Python:  
For Loop:  
```python

for i in range(1, 11):
    # Code to be repeated for each value of i
    print(i)
```
This for loop will print numbers from 1 to 10.  

While Loop:  
```python
counter = 1
while counter <= 10:
    # Code to be repeated while the condition is True
    print(counter)
    counter += 1
```
This while loop will also print numbers from 1 to 10. The loop continues as long as the condition (counter <= 10) is true.  

*Me:*  
makes sense, can you explain "counter += 1" I see it increments the counter but why that particular syntax?  

*ChatGPT:*  
Certainly! counter += 1 is a shorthand syntax for incrementing the value of a variable in Python. It's equivalent to writing counter = counter + 1. This kind of shorthand notation is common in many programming languages and is called an "augmented assignment statement."

Let's break it down:

    counter: This is the variable you are incrementing.
    +=: This is the augmented assignment operator for addition. It adds the value on the right side to the variable on the left side and then assigns the result back to the variable.

So, counter += 1 is saying "take the current value of counter, add 1 to it, and then assign the result back to counter." It's a concise way of expressing incrementation.  
Similarly, you can use -=, *=, /=, etc., for subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively.  
```python
counter = 1
counter += 1  # Increment by 1
print(counter)  # Output: 2

counter *= 2  # Multiply by 2
print(counter)  # Output: 4
```
It's a handy and readable way to perform common operations on variables.

*Me:*  
I have solved it:
```py
## Loops

# Request input (and check it's an integer)
number = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
counter = 1
#product = number + counter
while counter <= 12:
    #I'm doing 12 times table!
    print(int(number), "x", counter, "=", int(counter*number))
    counter += 1
```
I have questions though...  
I would like it to handle both whole and decimal numbers, and return the outputs without decimal places unless relevant. For example, if my number is 2, the result should be
```
1 x 2 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
```
and so on.

but if my number was 1.5 it should return 
```
1 x 1.5 = 1.5
2 x 1.5 = 3
```
and so on. can you help me understand how to achieve that?

*ChatGPT:*  
Certainly! To handle both whole and decimal numbers, you can adjust the format of your output. You can use the int() function to convert the result of the multiplication to an integer when the result is a whole number. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:
```python
# Request input (and check it's a float)
number = float(input("Please enter a number: "))
counter = 1

while counter <= 12:
    # Multiply the counter by the input number
    result = counter * number
    
    # Check if the result is a whole number
    if result.is_integer():
        # If it's a whole number, convert to int before printing
        print(int(counter), "x", int(number), "=", int(result))
    else:
        # If it's not a whole number, print with decimal places
        print(int(counter), "x", number, "=", result)

    counter += 1
```
In this modified version, the result.is_integer() method is used to check if the result is a whole number. If it is, the result is converted to an integer using int() before printing. If it's not a whole number, the result is printed as it is.

Give it a try, and let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like to adjust!

*Me:*  
I'd like to move onto some more questions

*ChatGPT:*  
Certainly! Let's explore some more programming concepts through challenges. Here's a set of tasks that cover a range of concepts:  
**Task 10: Lists and Loops**
Create a script that takes a user's input for the number of elements in a list. Then, ask the user to input each element of the list. Finally, print the elements of the list in reverse order. Use a loop to accomplish this.  
*Me:*  
I want to try all of them! lets start with task 10

*ChatGPT:*  
Great enthusiasm! Let's dive into Task 10: Lists and Loops.
Task 10: Lists and Loops

Create a script that takes a user's input for the number of elements in a list. Then, ask the user to input each element of the list. Finally, print the elements of the list in reverse order. Use a loop to accomplish this.

Feel free to give it a try, and share your solution when you're ready! If you encounter any challenges or have questions, I'm here to help.

*Me:*  
I have a question, I am trying to get the item input with a counter; 

while counter <= number:
    new_item = input("Please enter item number", counter, ": ")

*ChatGPT:*  
It looks like you're on the right track! However, when using input in this manner, you might run into an issue because input expects a single string as an argument. To include the value of counter in the prompt, you need to convert it to a string before passing it to input. You can do this using the str() function.  
Here's the modified code snippet:
```python
while counter <= number:
    new_item = input("Please enter item number " + str(counter) + ": ")
    # Rest of your code for processing the input
    counter += 1
```

Alternatively, you can use f-strings (available in Python 3.6 and newer) for a cleaner syntax:
```python

while counter <= number:
    new_item = input(f"Please enter item number {counter}: ")
    # Rest of your code for processing the input
    counter += 1
```

These changes ensure that the counter value is concatenated with the string prompt. Give it a try, and let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like to share more of your code for feedback!

*Me:*  
thanks, was struggling with that bit of syntax  

*ChatGPT:*  
You're welcome! Syntax nuances can sometimes be a bit tricky, so it's perfectly normal to encounter challenges. If you have any more questions or when you're ready to share your complete solution for Task 10, feel free to do so. I'm here to assist you!

*Me:*  
sorted:
```py
## Loops

# Request input (and check it's an integer)
while True:
    try:
        number = int(input("How many items are in this list? "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter an integer: ")
        
counter = 1
items = []

# Ask for the list items as many times as specified
while counter <= number:
    new_item = input(f"Please enter item number {counter}: ")
 # Keep track of the list items
    items.append(new_item)
    counter += 1
    
#Print the item list in reverse order
items.reverse()
print("Your list in reverse is ", *items, sep = "\n")
```

*ChatGPT:*  
Excellent job! Your solution to Task 10 looks well-structured and effectively uses loops and lists. Here's some feedback:
Feedback:

    Input Validation:
        Good use of a while loop and a try-except block to validate user input and ensure it's an integer.

    List Handling:
        Nicely done using a list (items) to store the user-entered items.

    Loop Structure:
        The loop structure is logically constructed, and you correctly increment the counter.

    Reverse Order:
        You used the reverse() method to reverse the order of the list items, and then printed them in reverse order.

    Formatted Output:
        The use of f-strings for the input prompt and the sep parameter in the print statement demonstrates good formatting.

Overall, your code effectively accomplishes the task! If you have any more questions, want to tackle another task, or explore additional concepts, feel free to let me know. Great job!

*Me:*  
anything I could improve or do more effectively?

*ChatGPT:*  
Your code is well-written, but I'll suggest a minor improvement to enhance the user experience. Currently, the program prompts the user to enter the number of items in the list and then sequentially asks for each item. You could consider providing a more informative prompt by mentioning the expected format of the items or giving an example.  
Here's an updated version with a more detailed prompt:
```python
# Request input (and check it's an integer)
while True:
    try:
        number = int(input("How many items are in this list? "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter an integer: ")

counter = 1
items = []

# Ask for the list items as many times as specified
while counter <= number:
    new_item = input(f"Please enter item number {counter} (e.g., 'apple', '123', etc.): ")
    # Keep track of the list items
    items.append(new_item)
    counter += 1

# Print the item list in reverse order
items.reverse()
print("Your list in reverse is ", *items, sep="\n")
```

This modification provides a more user-friendly prompt, especially when the items might have specific formats or types. It's a small enhancement, but it can make the interaction smoother for users.
