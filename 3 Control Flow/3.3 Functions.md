## Functions
A function is a reusable block of code which performs operations specified in the function. They allow tasks to be broken into smaller pieces and parts fo the code to be reused in different programs.


There are two types of functions :

* **Pre-defined functions** and  
* **User defined functions**

___
### Functions Make Things Simple
Consider the two lines of code in **Block 1** and **Block 2**: the procedure for each block is identical. The only thing that is different is the variable names and values.

**Block 1:**  
```py
# a and b calculation block1
a1 = 4
b1 = 5
c1 = a1 + b1 + 2 * a1 * b1 - 1
if(c1 < 0):
    c1 = 0 
else:
    c1 = 5
c1   
```

**Block 2:**  
```py
# a and b calculation block2
a2 = 0
b2 = 0
c2 = a2 + b2 + 2 * a2 * b2 - 1
if(c2 < 0):
    c2 = 0 
else:
    c2 = 5
c2   
```

We can replace the lines of code with a function. A function combines many instructions into a single line of code. Once a function is defined, it can be used repeatedly. You can invoke the same function many times in your program. You can save your function and use it in another program or use someone else’s function. The lines of code in code **Block 1** and code **Block 2** can be replaced by the following function:
```py
# Make a Function for the calculation above
def Equation(a,b):
    c = a + b + 2 * a * b - 1
    if(c < 0):
        c = 0 
    else:
        c = 5
    return(c) 
```

This function takes two inputs, a and b, then applies several operations to return c.
We simply define the function, replace the instructions with the function, and input the new values of `a1`, `b1` and `a2`, `b2` as inputs. The entire process is demonstrated in the figure:

Code **Blocks 1** and **Block 2** can now be replaced with code **Block 3** and code **Block 4**.

**Block 3:**  
```py
a1 = 4
b1 = 5
c1 = Equation(a1, b1)
c1
```

**Block 4:**  
```py
a2 = 0
b2 = 0
c2 = Equation(a2, b2)
c2
```

___
### Pre-defined functions
There are many pre-defined functions in Python, so let's start with the simple ones.

The `print()` function:
```py
# Build-in function print()

album_ratings = [10.0, 8.5, 9.5, 7.0, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 9.5] 
print(album_ratings)
```

The `sum()` function adds all the  elements in a list or tuple:
```py
# Use sum() to add every element in a list or tuple together

sum(album_ratings)
```

The `len()` function returns the length of a list or tuple:
```py
# Show the length of the list or tuple

len(album_ratings)
```

### In-Built functions
In Python, an in-built function is a pre-defined function that is always available for use, providing common functionality without requiring any imports. 

You will see below will return an error as integer alone is not considered while using a function.It either has to be in the form of tuple, list or a set.

```py
sum(1,2)
# Define a tuple
a = (1, 2)

# Pass the tuple to the sum function and store the result in a variable
c = sum(a)

# Print the result
print(f"The sum of the elements in the tuple {a} is {c}.")

# Define a list
a = [1, 2]

# Pass the list to the sum function and store the result in a variable
c = sum(a)

# Print the result
print(f"The sum of the elements in the list {a} is {c}.")
```

### User Defined Functions
The basic structure of a user defined function is:
* Functions blocks begin `def` followed by the function `name` and parentheses `()`.
* Input parameters or arguments should be placed within the parentheses.
* Preameters may also be defined within the parentheses.
* There is a body within every function that starts with a colon (`:`) and is indented.
* Documentation can be placed before the body.
* The statement `return` exits a function, optionally passing back a value.

Below is an example of a function that adds on to the parameter `a` prints and returns the output as `b`:
```py
# First function example: Add 1 to a and store as b
def add(a):
    """
    add 1 to a
    """
    b = a + 1
    print(a, "if you add one", b)
    return(b)
```

Help can be obtained about a function; this will call the documentation within the function.
```py
# Get a help on add function
help(add)
```

Functions can be called
```py
# Call the function add()
add(1)
```

If the fution is called with a new input, a different result is obtained.
```py
# Call the function add()
add(2)
```

Functions can be used to call other functions. For example, a function can be created that multiplies two numbers, using the ouput `b` of the 'add' function. The numbers will be represented by the variables `a` and `b`:
```py
# Define a function for multiple two numbers
def Mult(a, b):
    c = a * b
    return(c)
    print('This is not printed')
    
result = Mult(12,2)
print(result)
```

Note how the function terminates at the `return`  statement, while passing back a value. This value can be further assigned to a different variable as desired.  

The same function can be used for different data types. For example, two integers can be mutiplied
```py
# Use mult() multiply two integers
Mult(2, 3)
```

or two floats:
```py
# Use mult() multiply two floats
Mult(10.0, 3.14)
```

Or a [string](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.4%20String%20Operations.md#concatenation) can be replicated by multiplying with an integer:
We can even replicate a string by multiplying with an integer:
```py
# Use mult() multiply two different type values together
Mult(2, "Michael Jackson ")
```
___
## Variables
The input to a function is called a formal parameter.

A variable that is declared inside a function is called a  local variable. The parameter only exists within the function (i.e. the point where the function starts and stops).

A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout the program. We will discuss more about global variables at the end of the lab.
```py
# Function Definition
def square(a):   
    # Local variable b
    b = 1
    c = a * a + b
    print(a, "if you square + 1", c) 
    return(c)
```

We can call the function  with an input of **3**:
```py
# Initializes Global variable  
x = 3
# Makes function call and return function a y
y = square(x)
y
```

We can call the function  with an input of **2** in a different manner:
```py
# Directly enter a number as parameter
square(2)
```

If there is no `return` statement, the function returns `None`. The following two functions are equivalent:
```py
# Define functions, one with return value None and other without return value
def MJ():
    print('Michael Jackson')
    
def MJ1():
    print('Michael Jackson')
    return(None)
    
# See the output
MJ()

# See the output
MJ1()
```

Printing the function after a call reveals a **None** is the default return statement:
```py
# See what functions returns are
print(MJ())
print(MJ1())
```

Create a function `con` that  concatenates two strings using the addition operation:
```py
# Define the function for combining strings
def con(a, b):
    return(a + b)

# Test on the con() function
con("This ", "is")
```

___
### Scope of a Variable
The scope of a variable is the part of that program where that variable is accessible. Variables that are declared outside of all function definitions, such as the `myFavouriteBand` variable in the code shown here, are accessible from anywhere within the program. As a result, such variables are said to have global scope, and are known as global variables. `myFavouriteBand` is a global variable, so it is accessible from within the `getBandRating` function, and we can use it to determine a band's rating. We can also use it outside of the function, such as when we pass it to the print function to display it:
```py
# Example of global variable

myFavouriteBand = "AC/DC"

def getBandRating(bandname):
    if bandname == myFavouriteBand:
        return 10.0
    else:
        return 0.0

print("AC/DC's rating is:", getBandRating("AC/DC"))
print("Deep Purple's rating is:",getBandRating("Deep Purple"))
print("My favourite band is:", myFavouriteBand)
```

Take a look at this modified version of our code. Now the `myFavouriteBand` variable is defined within the `getBandRating` function. A variable that is defined within a function is said to be a local variable of that function. That means that it is only accessible from within the function in which it is defined. Our `getBandRating` function will still work, because `myFavouriteBand` is still defined within the function. However, we can no longer print `myFavouriteBand` outside our function, because it is a local variable of our `getBandRating` function; it is only defined within the `getBandRating` function:
```py
# Deleting the variable "myFavouriteBand" from the previous example to demonstrate an example of a local variable 

del myFavouriteBand

# Example of local variable

def getBandRating(bandname):
    myFavouriteBand = "AC/DC"
    if bandname == myFavouriteBand:
        return 10.0
    else:
        return 0.0

print("AC/DC's rating is: ", getBandRating("AC/DC"))
print("Deep Purple's rating is: ", getBandRating("Deep Purple"))
print("My favourite band is", myFavouriteBand)
```

Finally, take a look at this example. We now have two `myFavouriteBand` variable definitions. The first one of these has a global scope, and the second of them is a local variable within the `getBandRating` function. Within the `getBandRating` function, the local variable takes precedence. **Deep Purple** will receive a rating of 10.0 when passed to the `getBandRating` function. However, outside of the `getBandRating` function, the `getBandRating`s local variable is not defined, so the `myFavouriteBand variable we print is the global variable, which has a value of **AC/DC**:
```py
# Example of global variable and local variable with the same name

myFavouriteBand = "AC/DC"

def getBandRating(bandname):
    myFavouriteBand = "Deep Purple"
    if bandname == myFavouriteBand:
        return 10.0
    else:
        return 0.0

print("AC/DC's rating is:",getBandRating("AC/DC"))
print("Deep Purple's rating is: ",getBandRating("Deep Purple"))
print("My favourite band is:",myFavouriteBand)
```

___
### Global variables
So far, we've been creating variables within functions, but we have not discussed variables outside the function. These are called global variables.  
Let's try to see what `printer1` returns:
```py
# Example of global variable

artist = "Michael Jackson"
def printer1(artist):
    internal_var1 = artist
    print(artist, "is an artist")
    
printer1(artist)
```

try runningthe following code:
```py
printer1(internal_var1) 
```

*We got a Name Error:  `name 'internal_var'` is not defined. Why?*  
It's because all the variables we create in the function is a **local variable**, meaning that the variable assignment does not persist outside the function.

But there is a way to create **global variables** from within a function as follows:
```py
artist = "Michael Jackson"

def printer(artist):
    global internal_var 
    internal_var= "Whitney Houston"
    print(artist,"is an artist")

printer(artist) 
printer(internal_var)
```

___
## Default Arguments
You can set a default value for arguments in your function. For example, in the `isGoodRating()` function, what if we wanted to create a threshold for what we consider to be a good rating? Perhaps by default, we should have a default rating of 4:
```py
# Example for setting param with default value

def isGoodRating(rating=4): 
    if(rating < 7):
        print("this album sucks it's rating is",rating)
        
    else:
        print("this album is good its rating is",rating)

# Test the value with default value and with input

isGoodRating()
isGoodRating(10)
```

___
### Collections and Functions
When the number of arguments  are unknown for a function, They can all be packed into a tuple as shown:
```py
def printAll(*args): # All the arguments are 'packed' into args which can be treated like a tuple
    print("No of arguments:", len(args)) 
    for argument in args:
        print(argument)
#printAll with 3 arguments
printAll('Horsefeather','Adonis','Bone')
#printAll with 4 arguments
printAll('Sidecar','Long Island','Mudslide','Carriage')
```

Similarly, The arguments can also be packed into a dictionary as shown:
```py
def printDictionary(**args):
    for key in args:
        print(key + " : " + args[key])

printDictionary(Country='Canada',Province='Ontario',City='Toronto')
```

Functions can be incredibly powerful and versatile. They can accept (and return) data types, objects and even other functions as arguements. Consider the example below:
```py
def addItems(list):
    list.append("Three")
    list.append("Four")

myList = ["One","Two"]

addItems(myList)

myList
```

Note how the changes made to the list are not limited to the functions scope. This occurs as it is the lists **reference** that is passed to the function - Any changes made are on the orignal instance of the list. Therefore, one should be cautious when passing mutable objects into functions.


___
## Conditionals and Loops in Functions
The `return()` function is particularly useful if you have any `IF` statements in the function, when you want your output to be dependent on some condition:
```py
# Function example

def type_of_album(artist, album, year_released):
    
    print(artist, album, year_released)
    if year_released > 1980:
        return "Modern"
    else:
        return "Oldie"
    
x = type_of_album("Michael Jackson", "Thriller", 1980)
print(x)
```

We can use a loop in a function. For example, we can `print out each element in a list:
```py
# Print the list using for loop

def PrintList(the_list):
    for element in the_list:
        print(element)
# Implement the printlist function

PrintList(['1', 1, 'the man', "abc"])
```

String comparison in Functions:  
The relational operators compare the Unicode values of the characters of the strings from the zeroth index till the end of the string. It then returns a boolean value according to the operator used.
```py
#Compare Two Strings Directly using in operator
# add string
string= "Michael Jackson is the best"

# Define a funtion
def check_string(text):
    
# Use if else statement and 'in' operatore to compare the string
    if text in string:
        return 'String matched'
    else:
        return 'String not matched'

check_string("Michael Jackson is the best")
```

This program uses a user-defined function named `compareStrings()` to compare two strings. 

This function receives both strings as its argument and returns 1 if both strings are equal using `==` operator
```py
#Compare two strings using == operator and function
def compareStrings(x, y):
# Use if else statement to compare x and y
    if x==y:
        return 1
    
# Declare two different variables as string1 and string2 and pass string in it
string1 = "Michael Jackson is the best"
string2 = "Michael Jackson is the best"

# Declare a variable to store result after comparing both the strings
check = compareStrings(string1, string2)

#Use if else statement to compare the string
if check==1:
    print("\nString Matched")
else:
    print("\nString not Matched")
```

**Count the Frequency of Words Appearing in a String Using a Dictionary.**  
Find the count of occurence of any word in our string using python. This is what we are going to do in this section, count the number of word in a given string and print it.

Lets suppose we have a ‘string’ and the ‘word’ and we need to find the count of occurence of this word in our string using python. This is what we are going to do in this section, count the number of word in a given string and print it. 

The first thing, we will do is define a function and and then create a list that will be empty initially.

Next, we will add a code to convert the string to a list. Python string has a split() method. It takes a string and some separator to return a list.

Now we will declare an empty dictionary.

Next we will add code using for loop to iterate the words and value will will count the frequency of each words in the string and store them to the dictionary.

Finally we will print the dictionary.
```py
# Python Program to Count words in a String using Dictionary
def freq(string):
    
    #step1: A list variable is declared and initialized to an empty list.
    words = []
    
    #step2: Break the string into list of words
    words = string.split() # or string.lower().split()
    
    #step3: Declare a dictionary
    Dict = {}
    
    #step4: Use for loop to iterate words and values to the dictionary
    for key in words:
        Dict[key] = words.count(key)
        
    #step5: Print the dictionary
    print("The Frequency of words is:",Dict)
    
#step6: Call function and pass string in it
freq("Mary had a little lamb Little lamb, little lamb Mary had a little lamb.Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went Mary went, Mary went \
Everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go")
```
