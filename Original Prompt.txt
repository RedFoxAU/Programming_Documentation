### Be careful it changes what it responds with!

Below is a prompt you were given and your response; Beginning with Section 2, Topic 1 below can you act as a teacher and introduce the topic, and then give me a series of tasks one at a time with increasing difficulty until I become proficient?  If I need help with a task please offer suggestions, but don't outright give me the code answer (unless you are confirming that I have gotten something correct). I'd like this to be fun like a game. Here is the prompt and your response:
