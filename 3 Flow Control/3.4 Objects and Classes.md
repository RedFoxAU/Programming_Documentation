## Classes and Objects in Python

Python has many different kinds of data [types](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.2%20Types.md): Integers, Floats, [Strings](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.4%20String%20Operations.md), [Lists](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#Lists), [Dictionaries](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.3%20Dictionaries.md), Booleans; in Python each is an object. Every object has the following:
* A type,
* Internal representation
* A set of functions called methods to interact with the data.  

An object is an instance of a particular type, and example of this is every time a list is created, it is an instance of type list, or an list object.

A class or type's *methods* are functions that every instance of that class or type provides; these are the ways in which the object can be interacted with. using the list example, sorting is a method that interacts with the data in the object.  

___
### Creating a class

Classes or types can be created in python, complete with their own data attributes and methods. Instances of of a class can then be created. A class is defined by its data attributes.

___
*Matplotlib:*  
Matplotlib is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. the library can be installed with the command `pip install matplotlib`. Most of the Matplotlib utilities lies under the pyplot submodule.  

When using the library, it must be imported with
```py
# Import the library
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
___

Below is an example of creating a class Circle. 
```py
# Create a class Circle
class Circle(object):
    
    # Constructor - data attributes used to initialise object.
    def __init__(self, radius=3, color='blue'):
        self.radius = radius
        self.color = color 
    
    # Method
    def add_radius(self, r):
        self.radius = self.radius + r
        return(self.radius)
    
    # Method
    def drawCircle(self):
        plt.gca().add_patch(plt.Circle((0, 0), radius=self.radius, fc=self.color))
        plt.axis('scaled')
        plt.show()  
```

Classes are created using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and the parent; in this case object.

Next a special method called a constructor `\__init\_\_`, is used to initialize the object. The inputs are data attributes. The term `self` contains all the attributes in the set. For example the `self.color` gives the value of the attribute color and `self.radius` will give the radius of the object. There is also the method `add_radius()` with the parameter `r`, the method adds the value of `r` to the attribute radius. To access the radius the syntax `self.radius` is used. 

The actual object is shown below. We include the method `drawCircle` to display the image of a circle. We set the default radius to 3 and the default colour to blue:

### Instances of a Class - Objects and Attributes

After the class is created, in order to create an object of class circle, a variable is introduced; this will be the name of the object.  
The object is created using the object construtor, this consists of the name of the class, as well as the parameters. These are the data attributes. 

in order to create a circle object the code is called like a function. The arguments passed to the circle constructor are used to initialise the the data attributes of the newly created circle instance.  
```py
# Create an object RedCircle
RedCircle = Circle(10, 'red')
```

It is helpful to think of self as a box that contains all the data attributes of the object. Typing the object's name followed by a dot and the data attribute name gives the data attribute value, for example radius. In this case, the radius is ten.
We can do the same for color. We can see the relationship between the self parameter and the object.  
```py
# Print the object attribute radius
print(RedCircle.radius)

# Print the object attribute color
print(RedCircle.color)
```

Will output:
```
10
red
```

An object's data attributes can be changed directly, or using a method if one exists (see [below](/3%20Control%20Flow/3.4%20Objects%20and%20Classes.md#methods))
:
```py
# Set the object attribute radius
RedCircle.radius = 1
print(RedCircle.radius)
```

Will output:
```
1
```

___
### Methods

Methods provde a way to change or interact with an object; they are functions that interact with objects.  

The `dir` command can be used to get a list of an object's methods, many of them are default Python methods. 
```py
# Display methods for RedCircle
print(dir(RedCircle))
```

Will output:
```
['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getstate__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'add_radius', 'color', 
'drawCircle', 'radius']
```

using the `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` and the `drawCircle()` method, the circle can be printed.
```py
# Call the method drawCircle
RedCircle.drawCircle()
```
Will output:  
![matplotlib print of RedCircle](<3.4 RedCircle.png>)
*Matplotlib display of Redcircle*

The radius of the circle can be changed by applying the method `add_radius()`. The example below increases the radius by 2 and then by 5:
```py
# Use method to change the object attribute radius
print('Radius of object:',RedCircle.radius)
RedCircle.add_radius(2)
print('Radius of object of after applying the method add_radius(2):',RedCircle.radius)
RedCircle.add_radius(5)
print('Radius of object of after applying the method add_radius(5):',RedCircle.radius)
```

Will output:
```
Radius of object of after applying the method add_radius(2): 3
Radius of object of after applying the method add_radius(5): 8
```

```py
class Vehicle:
    color = "white"

    def __init__(self, max_speed, mileage):
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage
        self.seating_capacity = None

    def assign_seating_capacity(self, seating_capacity):
        self.seating_capacity = seating_capacity

    def display_properties(self):
        print("Properties of the Vehicle:")
        print("Color:", self.color)
        print("Maximum Speed:", self.max_speed)
        print("Mileage:", self.mileage)
        print("Seating Capacity:", self.seating_capacity)

# Creating objects of the Vehicle class
vehicle1 = Vehicle(200, 50000)
vehicle1.assign_seating_capacity(5)
vehicle1.display_properties()

vehicle2 = Vehicle(180, 75000)
vehicle2.assign_seating_capacity(4)
vehicle2.display_properties()
```
