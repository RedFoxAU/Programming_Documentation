### 2.2 **Sets**

*Let�s cover sets; they are also a type of collection.
Sets are a type of collection. This means that like lists and tuples, you
can input different python types. Unlike lists and tuples they are unordered.
This means sets do not record element position. Sets only have unique elements.
This means there is only one of a particular element in a set.
To define a set, you use curly brackets You place the elements of a set within the
curly brackets. You notice there are duplicate items.
When the actual set is created, duplicate items will not be present.
You can convert a list to a set by using the function set; this is called type-casting.
You simply use the list as the input to the function set.
The result will be a list converted to a set. Let's go over an example
We start off with a list. We input the list to the function set.
The function set returns a set. Notice how there are no duplicate elements.
Let�s go over Set Operations; these can be used to change the set.
Consider the set �A�. Let's represent this set with a circle.
If you are familiar with sets this can be part of a Venn diagram.
A Venn diagram is a tool that uses shapes usually to represent sets.
We can add an item to a set using the add method.
We just put the set name followed by a dot, then the add method.
The argument is the new element of the set we would like to add, in this case, "NSYNC".
The set "A" now has "NSYNC� as an item. If we add the same item twice, nothing will
happen as there can be no duplicates in a set.
Let�s say we would like to remove NSYNC from set A.
We can also remove an item from a set using the remove method.
We just put the set name followed by a dot then the remove method.
The argument is the element of the set we would like to remove, in this case, "NSYNC".
After the remove method is applied to the set, set "A" does not contain the item
"NSYNC�. You can use this method for any item in the set.
We can verify if an element is in the set
using the "in" command as follows. The command checks if the item, in this case,
"AC/DC" is in the set. If the item is in the set, it returns true.
If we look for an item that is not in the set, in this case for the item �Who�,
as the item is not in the set, we will get a false.
These are types of mathematical set operations; there are other operations we can do.
There are lots of useful mathematical operations we can do between sets.
Let's define the set "album_set_1", we can represent it using a red circle or Venn diagram.
Similarly, we can define the set "album_set_2�.
We can also represent it using a blue circle or Venn diagram.
The Intersection of two sets is a new set containing elements which are in both of those
sets. It's helpful to use Venn diagrams.
The two circles that represent the sets combine; the overlap represents the new set.
As the overlap is comprised of the red circle and blue circle, we define the intersection
in terms of �and.� In Python, we use the ampersand to find the
union of two sets. If we overlay the values of the set over the
circle placing the common elements in the overlapping area, we see the correspondence.
After applying the Intersection operation, all the items that are not in both sets disappear.
In Python, we simply just place the ampersand between the two sets.
We see that both "AC/DC" and "Back in Black" are in both sets.
The result is a new set album, set 3, containing all the elements in both album_set_1 and album
set 2. The union of two sets is the new set of elements
which contain all the items in both sets. We can find the union of the sets album set
1 and album_set_2 as follows. The result is a new set that has all the elements
of album_set_1 and album_set_2. This new set is represented in green.
Consider the new album set, "album_set_3"; the set contains the elements "AC/DC" and "Back
in Black�. We can represent this with a Venn diagram,
as all the elements in album_set_3 are in album_set_1.
The circle representing album_set_1 encapsulates the circle representing album_set_3.
We can check if a set is a subset using the is subset method.
As album_set_3 is a subset of the album_set_1, the result is true.
There is a lot more you can do with sets. Check out the lab for more examples.*

<h2 id="set">Sets</h2>

<h3 id="content">Set Content</h3>

A set is a unique collection of objects in Python. You can denote a set with a pair of curly brackets <b>{}</b>. Python will automatically remove duplicate items:

# Create a set

set1 = {"pop", "rock", "soul", "hard rock", "rock", "R&B", "rock", "disco"}
set1
The process of mapping is illustrated in the figure:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/SetsUnique.png" width="1100">

 You can also  create a set from a list as follows:

# Convert list to set

album_list = [ "Michael Jackson", "Thriller", 1982, "00:42:19", \
              "Pop, Rock, R&B", 46.0, 65, "30-Nov-82", None, 10.0]
album_set = set(album_list)             
album_set
Now let us create a set of  genres:

# Convert list to set

music_genres = set(["pop", "pop", "rock", "folk rock", "hard rock", "soul", \
                    "progressive rock", "soft rock", "R&B", "disco"])
music_genres
<h3 id="op">Set Operations</h3> 

Let us go over set operations, as these can be used to change the set. Consider the set <b>A</b>:

# Sample set

A = set(["Thriller", "Back in Black", "AC/DC"])
A
 We can add an element to a set using the <code>add()</code> method: 

# Add element to set

A.add("NSYNC")
A
 If we add the same element twice, nothing will happen as there can be no duplicates in a set:

# Try to add duplicate element to the set

A.add("NSYNC")
A
 We can remove an item from a set using the <code>remove</code> method:

# Remove the element from set

A.remove("NSYNC")
A
 We can verify if an element is in the set using the <code>in</code> command:

# Verify if the element is in the set

"AC/DC" in A
<h3 id="logic">Sets Logic Operations</h3>

Remember that with sets you can check the difference between sets, as well as the symmetric difference, intersection, and union:

 Consider the following two sets:

# Sample Sets

album_set1 = set(["Thriller", 'AC/DC', 'Back in Black'])
album_set2 = set([ "AC/DC", "Back in Black", "The Dark Side of the Moon"])
<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/SetsSamples.png" width="650">

# Print two sets

album_set1, album_set2
As both sets contain <b>AC/DC</b> and <b>Back in Black</b> we represent these common elements with the intersection of two circles.

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/SetsLogic.png" width="650">

You can find the intersect of two sets as follow using <code>&</code>:

# Find the intersections

intersection = album_set1 & album_set2
intersection
You can find all the elements that are only contained in <code>album_set1</code> using the <code>difference</code> method:

# Find the difference in set1 but not set2

album_set1.difference(album_set2)  
You only need to consider elements in <code>album_set1</code>; all the elements in <code>album_set2</code>, including the intersection, are not included.

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/SetsLeft.png" width="650">

The elements in <code>album_set2</code> but not in <code>album_set1</code> is given by:

album_set2.difference(album_set1)  
<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/SetsRight.png" width="650">

You can also find the intersection of <code>album_list1</code> and <code>album_list2</code>, using the <code>intersection</code> method:

# Use intersection method to find the intersection of album_list1 and album_list2

album_set1.intersection(album_set2)   
 This corresponds to the intersection of the two circles:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/SetsIntersect.png" width="650">

The union corresponds to all the elements in both sets, which is represented by coloring both circles:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/images/SetsUnion.png" width="650">

 The union is given by:

# Find the union of two sets

album_set1.union(album_set2)
And you can check if a set is a superset or subset of another set, respectively, like this:

# Check if superset

set(album_set1).issuperset(album_set2)   
# Check if subset

set(album_set2).issubset(album_set1)     
Here is an example where <code>issubset()</code> and <code>issuperset()</code> return true:

# Check if subset

set({"Back in Black", "AC/DC"}).issubset(album_set1) 
# Check if superset

album_set1.issuperset({"Back in Black", "AC/DC"})
