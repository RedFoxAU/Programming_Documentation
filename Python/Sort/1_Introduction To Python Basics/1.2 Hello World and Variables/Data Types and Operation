Data Types and Operation
Explore common data types (lists, tuples, dictionaries) and basic operations.

eep up the good work! Now, let's move on to the next task.
Task 2: Variables and Data Types

Create a script that declares variables of different data types (integer, float, string) and prints them. For example:

python

# Example
age = 25
height = 1.75
name = "John"

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)

Feel free to modify the values or add more variables. Once you've done this, let me know, and we'll discuss it!

___
all done:

age = 38
height = 1.6
name = "Amanda"

print ("Name: ", name)
print ("Height: ", height)
print ("Age: ", age)

Fantastic! You've successfully created a Python script that uses variables and prints their values. Here's some feedback:

    Variable Declaration:
        You correctly declared three variables (age, height, and name).

    Data Types:
        You used different data types: int for age, float for height, and str for name. This demonstrates Python's dynamic typing.

    Print Statements:
        You used the print() function to display the values of the variables.

    Formatting:
        Your script is well-formatted and easy to read. Good job!

Now, let's move on to the next task.
Task 3: Basic Operations

Create a script that performs basic operations on numbers. Declare two variables (e.g., num1 and num2), and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Print the results.

python

# Example
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

# Perform operations
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
division_result = num1 / num2

# Print results
print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference_result)
print("Product:", product_result)
print("Division:", division_result)

Give it a try, and let me know when you're ready to move forward!

___

Will do, where possible could you not show me the code solution until i have attempted it myself?

Absolutely, I'll refrain from providing the solution until you've had a chance to attempt the task. Take your time, and whenever you're ready, share your solution, and we can discuss it!

Getting Fancy now:

## Numerical operations

#Define Numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3

## Perform Opertaions
sum_result = num1 + num2
subtract_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
division_result = num1 / num2

#Print results
print ("The numbers are: ", num1, " and ",num2)
print ("Sum is: ", sum_result)
print ("Difference is: ", subtract_result)
print ("Product is: ", product_result)
print ("Division is: ", division_result)## Numerical operations

Excellent job! You've successfully created a Python script that performs basic numerical operations. Here's some feedback:

    Variable Naming:
        You appropriately named your variables (num1, num2, sum_result, etc.), which makes your code easy to understand.

    Performing Operations:
        You correctly used operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to perform operations.

    Print Statements:
        Your print statements effectively display the numbers and the results of the operations.

    Code Repetition:
        In Python, you don't need to declare the variables twice. You can reuse the same variables throughout your script.

Great work! Let's continue with the next task.
