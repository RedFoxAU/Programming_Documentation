1.3 **Expressions and Variables**


4. Input from User:
```python

# Example of taking input from the user
user_input = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + user_input + "!")
```

```python
## Declare Variables of different types 

age = 38
height = 1.6
name = "Amanda"

print ("Name: ", name, type(name))
print ("Height: ", height, type(height))
print ("Age: ", age, type(age))
```


*In this video we�ll cover expressions and variables.
Expressions describe a type of operation that computers perform.
Expressions are operations that Python performs. For example, basic arithmetic operations like
adding multiple numbers. The result, in this case, is 160.
We call the numbers operands and the maths symbols, in this case addition, are called
operators. We can perform operations such as subtraction
using the subtraction sign. In this case, the result is a negative number.
We can perform multiplication operations using the asterisk. The result is 25.
In this case the operands are given by � and *.
We can also perform division with the forward slash.
25 divided by 5 is 5. 25 divided by 6 is approximately 4.167.
In Python 3, the version we will be using in this course, both will result in a float.
We can use the double slash for integer division, where the result is rounded.
Be aware, in some cases, the results are not the same as regular division.
Python follows mathematical conventions when performing mathematical expressions.
The following operations are in a different order.
In both cases, Python performs multiplication, then addition to obtain the final result.
There are a lot more operations you can do with Python. Check the labs for more examples.
We will also be covering more complex operations throughout the course.
The expressions in the parentheses are performed first. We then multiply the result by 60,
the result is 1920. Now let�s look at variables.
We can use variables to store values, in this case, we assign a value of 1 to the variable
my_variable using the assignment operator i.e., the equals sign.
We can then use the value somewhere else in the code by typing the exact name of the variable.
We will use a colon do denote the value of the variable.
We can assign a new value to my_variable using the assignment operator.
We assign a value of 10. The variable now has a value of 10.
The old value of the variable is not important. We can store the results of expressions, for
example, we add several values and assign the result to x.
x now stores the result. We can also perform operations on x and save
the result to a new variable y. y now has a value of 2.666
We can also perform operations on x and assign the value x.
The variable x now has a value 2.666. As before, the old value of x is not important.
We can use the type command in variables as well.
It's good practice to use meaningful variable names, so you don't have to keep track of
what the variable is doing. Let�s say we would like to convert the number
of minutes in the highlighted examples to number of hours in the following music dataset.
We call the variable that contains the total number of minutes, total_min. It�s common
to use the underscore to represent the start of a new word, you can also use a capital
letter. We call the variable that contains the total
number of hours total_hr. We can obtain the total number of hours by
dividing total_min by 60. The result is approximately 2.367 hours.
If we modify the value of the first variable, the value of the variable will change.
The final result values change accordingly, but we do not have to modify the rest of the
code.*

Now, let's move on to the next task.  
Task 3: Basic Operations:  
Create a script that performs basic operations on numbers. Declare two variables (e.g., num1 and num2), and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Print the results.
```python
# Example
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

# Perform operations
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
division_result = num1 / num2

# Print results
print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference_result)
print("Product:", product_result)
print("Division:", division_result)
```
Give it a try, and let me know when you're ready to move forward!

___

*Me:*  
Will do, where possible could you not show me the code solution until i have attempted it myself?  

*ChatGPT:*  
Absolutely, I'll refrain from providing the solution until you've had a chance to attempt the task. Take your time, and whenever you're ready, share your solution, and we can discuss it!
___
*Me:*  
Getting Fancy now:
```python
## Numerical operations

#Define Numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3

## Perform Opertaions
sum_result = num1 + num2
subtract_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
division_result = num1 / num2

#Print results
print ("The numbers are: ", num1, " and ",num2)
print ("Sum is: ", sum_result)
print ("Difference is: ", subtract_result)
print ("Product is: ", product_result)
print ("Division is: ", division_result)## Numerical operations
```

*ChatGPT:*  
Excellent job! You've successfully created a Python script that performs basic numerical operations. Here's some feedback:

    Variable Naming:
        You appropriately named your variables (num1, num2, sum_result, etc.), which makes your code easy to understand.

    Performing Operations:
        You correctly used operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to perform operations.

    Print Statements:
        Your print statements effectively display the numbers and the results of the operations.

    Code Repetition:
        In Python, you don't need to declare the variables twice. You can reuse the same variables throughout your script.

___

*Note Point 4, I coudl have done the operations in the print statement.

*Me:*  
I have mostly solved it, I am getting an error though; `TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'` can you explain what this means?  

*ChatGPT:*  
Certainly! The error you're encountering, TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int', suggests that you're trying to use the less than or equal to (<=) operator between a string and an integer.

*In Python, when you receive input using the input() function, it is treated as a string by default.* If you're comparing the input to numerical values, you need to convert the input to an integer using the int() function.

Here's a brief explanation and a potential solution:  
Let's say you have code like this:
```python

age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```
In this case, age is a string, and when you try to compare it with integers using <=, Python raises the mentioned error.

To fix this, convert age to an integer:
```python

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```

This ensures that age is treated as an integer, allowing you to use numerical comparisons without encountering a TypeError.
___

*Me:*  
oh yeah.... I did, but forgot to use that further on. 
```python
## User input and Conditionals

# Request user's age
age = input ("What is your age? ")

# Convert age to integer
int_age = int(age)

# Use if Stetement to parse number and print a response
if age <= 17:   
    print ("No Booze for you!")
    
elif age <= 65:
    print ("Drink up while you can!")

else:
    print ("You're over the hill - you can still drink though!")
```

is wrong, but 
```python
## User input and Conditionals

# Request user's age
age = input ("What is your age? ")

# Convert age to integer
int_age = int(age)

# Use if Stetement to parse number and print a response
if int_age <= 17:   
    print ("No Booze for you!")
    
elif int_age <= 65:
    print ("Drink up while you can!")

else:
    print ("You're over the hill - you can still drink though!")
```
works!

*ChatGPT:*  
Exactly! You nailed it! The error occurred because you initially used the input() function to get the age as a string, and then you correctly converted it to an integer with int(). The corrected version with int_age in the conditional statements is the right way to go.
Feedback:

    Variable Naming:
        You correctly used int_age after converting the user input to an integer, making your code clearer.

    Conditional Logic:
        Your conditional statements are appropriately structured to handle different age ranges.

    User Input:
        You successfully used the input() function to get user input.

**Task 6: Temperature Conversion**  
Create a script that takes a temperature in Celsius as user input and converts it to Fahrenheit. The conversion formula is: `F=95×C+32`

Ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, perform the conversion, and print the result.  
___

*Me:*  
Please give me some feedback on this solution to task 6:
```python
## Conversion from Celcius to Farenheit
degree_sign = u"\u00b0"
# Request input
temp = input ("What is the Celcius temperature that you would like to convert to farenheiht? ")

# Convert input temp to float
float_temp = float(temp)

# Convert the temp into farenheight
farenheit = (9/5) * float_temp + 32 

# Print the tempertaure in farenheight
print (temp, degree_sign, "C Is " ,farenheit ,degree_sign,"F")
```

*ChatGPT:*  
Your solution to Task 6 looks great! Here's some feedback:
Feedback:

    Variable Naming:
        You used meaningful variable names like float_temp and farenheit, making your code easy to understand.

### Modulo  

*Me:*  
Thank you for explaining, could you also explain the "%" operator in this line "elif number % 2 != 0:" and tell me why that is preferred to using the odd and even options?  

*ChatGPT:*  
Certainly! The % operator in Python is called the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. In the context of checking for odd or even numbers, the modulo operator is used to check if a number is divisible by 2.

Now, let's break down the line of code you asked about:
```py
elif number % 2 != 0:
```
`number % 2`: This calculates the remainder when number is divided by 2.
!= 0: This checks if the remainder is not equal to 0.  
In other words, this condition checks if number is not divisible evenly by 2, meaning it has a remainder when divided by 2. If there's a remainder, it's an odd number; if there's no remainder, it's an even number.

This approach is preferred for a few reasons:
    
    Simplicity: It's a concise and clear way to check for odd or even numbers without introducing unnecessary variables.  
    Readability: The use of % in this context is a common idiom in programming and is easily recognizable for those familiar with the language.  
    Efficiency: It's generally more efficient than creating additional variables and performing equality checks.

Here's a comparison with using odd and even options:
```python

# Using modulo operator
elif number % 2 != 0:

# Using odd and even options
elif number == odd:
# or
elif number == even:
```
The modulo approach is simpler, more idiomatic, and directly conveys the intention of checking for odd or even numbers. It's a good practice to use it in such contexts in Python.
