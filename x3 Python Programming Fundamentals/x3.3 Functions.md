### 3.3 **Functions**

7. Functions:
```python
# Example of a function
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Call the function
greet("Alice")
```

*In this video we will cover functions. You will learn how to use some of Python�s built-in
functions as well as how to build your own functions.
Functions take some input then produce some output or change.
The function is just a piece of code you can reuse.
You can implement your own function, but in many cases, you use other people�s functions.
In this case, you just have to know how the function works and in some cases how to import
the functions. Let the orange and yellow squares represent
similar blocks of code. We can run the code using some input and get
an output. If we define a function to do the task we
just have to call the function. Let the small squares represent the lines
of code used to call the function. We can replace these long lines of code by
just calling the function a few times. Now we can just call the function; our code
is much shorter. The code performs the same task.
You can think of the process like this: when we call the function f1, we pass an input
to the function. These values are passed to all those lines of code you wrote.
This returns a value; you can use the value. For example, you can input this value to a
new function f2. When we call this new function f2, the value
is passed to another set of lines of code. The function returns a value.
The process is repeated passing the values to the function you call.
You can save these functions and reuse them, or use other people�s functions.
Python has many built-in functions; you don't have to know how those functions work internally,
but simply what task those functions perform. The function len takes in an input of type
sequence, such as a string or list, or type collection, such as a dictionary or set, and
returns the length of that sequence or collection. Consider the following list.
The len function takes this list as an argument, and we assign the result to the variable L.
The function determines there are 8 items in the list, then returns the length of the
list, in this case, 8. The function sum takes in an iterable like
a tuple or list and returns the total of all the elements.
Consider the following list. We pass the list into the sum function and
assign the result to the variable S. The function determines the total of all the
elements, then returns it, in this case, the value is 70.
There are two ways to sort a list. The first is using the function sorted.
We can also use the list method sort. Methods are similar to functions.
Let's use this as an example to illustrate the difference.
The function sorted Returns a new sorted list or tuple.
Consider the list album ratings. We can apply the function sorted to the list
album ratings and get a new list sorted album rating.
The result is a new sorted list. If we look at the list album ratings, nothing
has changed. Generally, functions take an input, in this
case, a list. They produce a new output, in this instance, a sorted list.
If we use the method sort, the list album ratings will change and no new list will be
created. Let's use this diagram to help illustrate
the process. In this case, the rectangle represents the
list album ratings. When we apply the method sort to the list,
the list album rating changes. Unlike the previous case, we see that the
list album rating has changed. In this case, no new list is created.
Now that we have gone over how to use functions in Python, let�s see how to build our own
functions. We will now get you started on building your
own functions in python. This is an example of a function in python
that returns its input value + 1. To define a function, we start with the keyword
def. The name of the function should be descriptive
of what it does. We have the function formal parameter "A"
in parentheses. Followed by a colon.
We have a code block with an indent, for this case, we add 1 to "A" and assign it to B.
We return or output the value for b. After we define the function, we can call
it. The function will add 1 to 5 and return a
6. We can call the function again; this time
assign it to the variable "c" The value for 'c' is 11.
Let's explore this further. Let's go over an example when you call a function.
It should be noted that this is a simplified model of Python, and Python does not work
like this under the hood. We call the function giving it an input, 5.
It helps to think of the value of 5 as being passed to the function.
Now the sequences of commands are run, the value of "A" is 5.
"B" would be assigned a value of 6. We then return the value of b, in this case,
as b was assigned a value of 6, the function returns a 6.
If we call the function again, the process starts from scratch; we pass in an 8.
The subsequent operations are performed. Everything that happened in the last call
will happen again with a different value of "A"
The function returns a value, in this case, 9.
Again, this is just a helpful analogy. Let�s try and make this function more complex.
It's customary to document the function on the first few lines; this tells anyone who
uses the function what it does. This documentation is surrounded in triple
quotes. You can use the help command on the function
to display the documentation as follows. This will printout the function name and the
documentation. We will not include the documentation in the
rest of the examples. A function can have multiple parameters.
The function mult multiplies two numbers; in other words, it finds their product.
If we pass the integers 2 and 3, the result is a new integer.
If we pass the integer 10 and the float 3.14, the result is a float 31.4.
If we pass in the integer two and the string �Michael Jackson,� the string Michael
Jackson is repeated two times. This is because the multiplication symbol
can also mean repeat a sequence. If you accidentally multiply an integer and
a String instead of two integers, you won�t get an error.
Instead, you will get a String, and your program will progress, potentially failing later because
you have a String where you expected an integer. This property will make coding simpler, but
you must test your code more thoroughly. In many cases a function does not have a return
statement. In these cases, Python will return the special
�None� object. Practically speaking, if your function has
no return statement, you can treat it as if the function returns nothing at all.
The function MJ simply prints the name 'Michael Jackson�.
We call the function. The function prints �Michael Jackson.�
Let's define the function �No work� that performs no task.
Python doesn�t allow a function to have an empty body, so we can use the keyword pass,
which doesn�t do anything, but satisfies the requirement of a non-empty body.
If we call the function and print it out, the function returns a None.
In the background, if the return statement is not called, Python will automatically return
a None. It is helpful to view the function No Work
with the following return statement. Usually, functions perform more than one task.
This function prints a statement then returns a value.
Let's use this table to represent the different values as the function is called.
We call the function with an input of 2. We find the value of b.
The function prints the statement with the values of a and b.
Finally, the function returns the value of b, in this case, 3.
We can use loops in functions. This function prints out the values and indexes
of a loop or tuple. We call the function with the list album ratings
as an input. Let's display the list on the right with its
corresponding index. Stuff is used as an input to the function
enumerate. This operation will pass the index to i and
the value in the list to �s�. The function would begin to iterate through
the loop. The function will print the first index and
the first value in the list. We continue iterating through the loop.
The values of i and s are updated. The print statement is reached.
Similarly, the next values of the list and index are printed.
The process is repeated. The values of i and s are updated.
We continue iterating until the final values in the list are printed out.
Variadic parameters allow us to input a variable number of elements.
Consider the following function; the function has an asterisk on the parameter names.
When we call the function, three parameters are packed into the tuple names.
We then iterate through the loop; the values are printed out accordingly.
If we call the same function with only two parameters as inputs, the variable names only
contain two elements. The result is only two values are printed
out. The scope of a variable is the part of the
program where that variable is accessible. Variables that are defined outside of any
function are said to be within the global scope, meaning they can be accessed anywhere
after they are defined. Here we have a function that adds the string
DC to the parameter x. When we reach the part where the value of
x is set to AC, this is within the global scope, meaning x is accessible anywhere after
it is defined. A variable defined in the global scope is
called a global variable. When we call the function, we enter a new
scope or the scope of AddDC. We pass as an argument to the AddDC function,
in this case, AC. Within the scope of the function, the value
of x is set to ACDC. The function returns the value and is assigned
to z. Within the global scope, the value z is set
to ACDC After the value is returned, the scope of
the function is deleted. Local variables only exist within the scope
of a function. Consider the function thriller; the local
variable Date is set to 1982. When we call the function, we create a new
scope. Within that scope of the function, the value
of the date is set to 1982. The value of date does not exist within the
global scope. Variables inside the global scope can have
the same name as variables in the local scope with no conflict.
Consider the function thriller; the local variable Date is set to 1982.
The global variable date is set to 2017. When we call the function, we create a new
scope. Within that scope, the value of the date is
set to 1982. If we call the function, it returns the value
of Date in the local scope, in this case, 1982.
(click6) When we print in the global scope, we use the global variable value.
The global value of the variable is 2017. Therefore, the value is set to 2017.
If a variable is not defined within a function, Python will check the global scope.
Consider the function "AC-DC�. The function has the variable rating, with no value assigned.
If we define the variable rating in the global scope, then call the function, Python will
see there is no value for the variable Rating. As a result, python will leave the scope and
check if the variable Ratings exists in the global scope. It will use this value of Ratings
in the global scope within the scope of "AC-DC�. In the function, will print out a 9.
The value of z in the global scope will be 10, as we added one.
The value of rating will be unchanged within the global scope.
Consider the function Pink Floyd. If we define the variable Claimed Sales with
the keyword global, the variable will be a global variable.
We call the function Pink Floyd. The variable claimed sales is set to the string
�45 million� in the global scope. When we print the variable, we get a value
of �45 million.� There is a lot more you can do with functions.

<h2 id="func">Functions</h2>

A function is a reusable block of code which performs operations specified in the function. They let you break down tasks and allow you to reuse your code in different programs.

There are two types of functions :

*   <b>Pre-defined functions</b>
*   <b>User defined functions</b>

<h3 id="content">What is a Function?</h3>

You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python:

*   Functions blocks begin <code>def</code> followed by the function <code>name</code> and parentheses <code>()</code>.
*   There are input parameters or arguments that should be placed within these parentheses.
*   You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.
*   There is a body within every function that starts with a colon (<code>:</code>) and is indented.
*   You can also place documentation before the body.
*   The statement <code>return</code> exits a function, optionally passing back a value.

An example of a function that adds on to the parameter <code>a</code> prints and returns the output as <code>b</code>:

# First function example: Add 1 to a and store as b

def add(a):
    """
    add 1 to a
    """
    b = a + 1
    print(a, "if you add one", b)
    return(b)
The figure below illustrates the terminology:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/FuncsDefinition.png" width="500"> 

We can obtain help about a function :

# Get a help on add function

help(add)
We can call the function:

# Call the function add()

add(1)
If we call the function with a new input we get a new result:

# Call the function add()

add(2)
We can create different functions. For example, we can create a function that multiplies two numbers. The numbers will be represented by the variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>:

# Define a function for multiple two numbers

def Mult(a, b):
    c = a * b
    return(c)
    print('This is not printed')
    
result = Mult(12,2)
print(result)
The same function can be used for different data types. For example, we can multiply two integers:

# Use mult() multiply two integers

Mult(2, 3)
Note how the function terminates at the <code> return </code> statement, while passing back a value. This value can be further assigned to a different variable as desired.

<hr>
The same function can be used for different data types. For example, we can multiply two integers:

Two Floats:

# Use mult() multiply two floats

Mult(10.0, 3.14)
We can even replicate a string by multiplying with an integer:

# Use mult() multiply two different type values together

Mult(2, "Michael Jackson ")
<h3 id="var">Variables</h3>

The input to a function is called a formal parameter.

A variable that is declared inside a function is called a  local variable. The parameter only exists within the function (i.e. the point where the function starts and stops).

A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout the program. We will discuss more about global variables at the end of the lab.

# Function Definition

def square(a):
    
    # Local variable b
    b = 1
    c = a * a + b
    print(a, "if you square + 1", c) 
    return(c)
The labels are displayed in the figure:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/FuncsVar.png" width="500">

We can call the function  with an input of <b>3</b>:

# Initializes Global variable  

x = 3
# Makes function call and return function a y
y = square(x)
y
We can call the function  with an input of <b>2</b> in a different manner:

# Directly enter a number as parameter

square(2)
If there is no <code>return</code> statement, the function returns <code>None</code>. The following two functions are equivalent:

# Define functions, one with return value None and other without return value

def MJ():
    print('Michael Jackson')
    
def MJ1():
    print('Michael Jackson')
    return(None)
# See the output

MJ()
# See the output

MJ1()
Printing the function after a call reveals a **None** is the default return statement:

# See what functions returns are

print(MJ())
print(MJ1())
Create a function <code>con</code> that  concatenates two strings using the addition operation:

# Define the function for combining strings

def con(a, b):
    return(a + b)
# Test on the con() function

con("This ", "is")

        <h4> [Tip] How do I learn more about the pre-defined functions in Python? </h4>
        <p>We will be introducing a variety of pre-defined functions to you as you learn more about Python. There are just too many functions, so there's no way we can teach them all in one sitting. But if you'd like to take a quick peek, here's a short reference card for some of the commonly-used pre-defined functions: <a href="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/Python_reference_sheet.pdf?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkPY0101ENSkillsNetwork19487395-2022-01-01">Reference</a></p>

<h3 id="simple">Functions Make Things Simple</h3>

Consider the two lines of code in <b>Block 1</b> and <b>Block 2</b>: the procedure for each block is identical. The only thing that is different is the variable names and values.

<h4>Block 1:</h4>

# a and b calculation block1

a1 = 4
b1 = 5
c1 = a1 + b1 + 2 * a1 * b1 - 1
if(c1 < 0):
    c1 = 0 
else:
    c1 = 5
c1   
<h4>Block 2:</h4>

# a and b calculation block2

a2 = 0
b2 = 0
c2 = a2 + b2 + 2 * a2 * b2 - 1
if(c2 < 0):
    c2 = 0 
else:
    c2 = 5
c2   
We can replace the lines of code with a function. A function combines many instructions into a single line of code. Once a function is defined, it can be used repeatedly. You can invoke the same function many times in your program. You can save your function and use it in another program or use someone else’s function. The lines of code in code <b>Block 1</b> and code <b>Block 2</b> can be replaced by the following function:

# Make a Function for the calculation above

def Equation(a,b):
    c = a + b + 2 * a * b - 1
    if(c < 0):
        c = 0 
    else:
        c = 5
    return(c) 
This function takes two inputs, a and b, then applies several operations to return c.
We simply define the function, replace the instructions with the function, and input the new values of <code>a1</code>, <code>b1</code> and <code>a2</code>, <code>b2</code> as inputs. The entire process is demonstrated in the figure:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/FuncsPros.gif" width="850">

Code **Blocks 1** and **Block 2** can now be replaced with code **Block 3** and code **Block 4**.

<h4>Block 3:</h4>

a1 = 4
b1 = 5
c1 = Equation(a1, b1)
c1
<h4>Block 4:</h4>

a2 = 0
b2 = 0
c2 = Equation(a2, b2)
c2
<hr>

<h2 id="pre">Pre-defined functions</h2>

There are many pre-defined functions in Python, so let's start with the simple ones.

The <code>print()</code> function:

# Build-in function print()

album_ratings = [10.0, 8.5, 9.5, 7.0, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 9.5] 
print(album_ratings)
The <code>sum()</code> function adds all the  elements in a list or tuple:

# Use sum() to add every element in a list or tuple together

sum(album_ratings)
The <code>len()</code> function returns the length of a list or tuple:

# Show the length of the list or tuple

len(album_ratings)
<h2 id="pre">In-Built functions</h2>

In Python, an in-built function is a pre-defined function that is always available for use, providing common functionality without requiring any imports. 

#You will see below will return an error as integer alone is not considered while using a function.It either has to be in the form of tuple, list or a set.

sum(1,2)
# Define a tuple
a = (1, 2)

# Pass the tuple to the sum function and store the result in a variable
c = sum(a)

# Print the result
print(f"The sum of the elements in the tuple {a} is {c}.")

# Define a list
a = [1, 2]

# Pass the list to the sum function and store the result in a variable
c = sum(a)

# Print the result
print(f"The sum of the elements in the list {a} is {c}.")

<h2 id="if">Using <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> Statements and Loops in Functions</h2>

The <code>return()</code> function is particularly useful if you have any IF statements in the function, when you want your output to be dependent on some condition:

# Function example

def type_of_album(artist, album, year_released):
    
    print(artist, album, year_released)
    if year_released > 1980:
        return "Modern"
    else:
        return "Oldie"
    
x = type_of_album("Michael Jackson", "Thriller", 1980)
print(x)
We can use a loop in a function. For example, we can <code>print</code> out each element in a list:

# Print the list using for loop

def PrintList(the_list):
    for element in the_list:
        print(element)
# Implement the printlist function

PrintList(['1', 1, 'the man', "abc"])
<h2 id="if">String comparison in Functions</h2>

The relational operators compare the Unicode values of the characters of the strings from the zeroth index till the end of the string. It then returns a boolean value according to the operator used.

#Compare Two Strings Directly using in operator
# add string
string= "Michael Jackson is the best"

# Define a funtion
def check_string(text):
    
# Use if else statement and 'in' operatore to compare the string
    if text in string:
        return 'String matched'
    else:
        return 'String not matched'

check_string("Michael Jackson is the best")
This program uses a user-defined function named compareStrings() to compare two strings. 

This function receives both strings as its argument and returns 1 if both strings are equal using == operator

#Compare two strings using == operator and function
def compareStrings(x, y):
# Use if else statement to compare x and y
    if x==y:
        return 1
    
# Declare two different variables as string1 and string2 and pass string in it
string1 = "Michael Jackson is the best"
string2 = "Michael Jackson is the best"

# Declare a variable to store result after comparing both the strings
check = compareStrings(string1, string2)

#Use if else statement to compare the string
if check==1:
    print("\nString Matched")
else:
    print("\nString not Matched")
**Count the Frequency of Words Appearing in a String Using a Dictionary.** 

Find the count of occurence of any word in our string using python. This is what we are going to do in this section, count the number of word in a given string and print it.

Lets suppose we have a ‘string’ and the ‘word’ and we need to find the count of occurence of this word in our string using python. This is what we are going to do in this section, count the number of word in a given string and print it. 

The first thing, we will do is define a function and and then create a list that will be empty initially.

Next, we will add a code to convert the string to a list. Python string has a split() method. It takes a string and some separator to return a list.

Now we will declare an empty dictionary.

Next we will add code using for loop to iterate the words and value will will count the frequency of each words in the string and store them to the dictionary.

Finally we will print the dictionary.

# Python Program to Count words in a String using Dictionary
def freq(string):
    
    #step1: A list variable is declared and initialized to an empty list.
    words = []
    
    #step2: Break the string into list of words
    words = string.split() # or string.lower().split()
    
    #step3: Declare a dictionary
    Dict = {}
    
    #step4: Use for loop to iterate words and values to the dictionary
    for key in words:
        Dict[key] = words.count(key)
        
    #step5: Print the dictionary
    print("The Frequency of words is:",Dict)
    
#step6: Call function and pass string in it
freq("Mary had a little lamb Little lamb, little lamb Mary had a little lamb.Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went Mary went, Mary went \
Everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go")

<h2 id="default">Setting default argument values in your custom functions</h2>

You can set a default value for arguments in your function. For example, in the <code>isGoodRating()</code> function, what if we wanted to create a threshold for what we consider to be a good rating? Perhaps by default, we should have a default rating of 4:

# Example for setting param with default value

def isGoodRating(rating=4): 
    if(rating < 7):
        print("this album sucks it's rating is",rating)
        
    else:
        print("this album is good its rating is",rating)

# Test the value with default value and with input

isGoodRating()
isGoodRating(10)
<hr>

<h2 id="global">Global variables</h2>

So far, we've been creating variables within functions, but we have not discussed variables outside the function. These are called global variables. <br>
Let's try to see what <code>printer1</code> returns:

# Example of global variable

artist = "Michael Jackson"
def printer1(artist):
    internal_var1 = artist
    print(artist, "is an artist")
    
printer1(artist)
# try runningthe following code
#printer1(internal_var1) 
<b>We got a Name Error:  <code>name 'internal_var' is not defined</code>. Why?</b>

It's because all the variables we create in the function is a <b>local variable</b>, meaning that the variable assignment does not persist outside the function.

But there is a way to create <b>global variables</b> from within a function as follows:

artist = "Michael Jackson"

def printer(artist):
    global internal_var 
    internal_var= "Whitney Houston"
    print(artist,"is an artist")

printer(artist) 
printer(internal_var)
<h2 id="scope">Scope of a Variable</h2>

The scope of a variable is the part of that program where that variable is accessible. Variables that are declared outside of all function definitions, such as the <code>myFavouriteBand</code> variable in the code shown here, are accessible from anywhere within the program. As a result, such variables are said to have global scope, and are known as global variables. <code>myFavouriteBand</code> is a global variable, so it is accessible from within the <code>getBandRating</code> function, and we can use it to determine a band's rating. We can also use it outside of the function, such as when we pass it to the print function to display it:

# Example of global variable

myFavouriteBand = "AC/DC"

def getBandRating(bandname):
    if bandname == myFavouriteBand:
        return 10.0
    else:
        return 0.0

print("AC/DC's rating is:", getBandRating("AC/DC"))
print("Deep Purple's rating is:",getBandRating("Deep Purple"))
print("My favourite band is:", myFavouriteBand)
Take a look at this modified version of our code. Now the <code>myFavouriteBand</code> variable is defined within the <code>getBandRating</code> function. A variable that is defined within a function is said to be a local variable of that function. That means that it is only accessible from within the function in which it is defined. Our <code>getBandRating</code> function will still work, because <code>myFavouriteBand</code> is still defined within the function. However, we can no longer print <code>myFavouriteBand</code> outside our function, because it is a local variable of our <code>getBandRating</code> function; it is only defined within the <code>getBandRating</code> function:

# Deleting the variable "myFavouriteBand" from the previous example to demonstrate an example of a local variable 

del myFavouriteBand

# Example of local variable

def getBandRating(bandname):
    myFavouriteBand = "AC/DC"
    if bandname == myFavouriteBand:
        return 10.0
    else:
        return 0.0

print("AC/DC's rating is: ", getBandRating("AC/DC"))
print("Deep Purple's rating is: ", getBandRating("Deep Purple"))
print("My favourite band is", myFavouriteBand)
Finally, take a look at this example. We now have two <code>myFavouriteBand</code> variable definitions. The first one of these has a global scope, and the second of them is a local variable within the <code>getBandRating</code> function. Within the <code>getBandRating</code> function, the local variable takes precedence. **Deep Purple** will receive a rating of 10.0 when passed to the <code>getBandRating</code> function. However, outside of the <code>getBandRating</code> function, the <code>getBandRating</code> s local variable is not defined, so the <code>myFavouriteBand</code> variable we print is the global variable, which has a value of **AC/DC**:

# Example of global variable and local variable with the same name

myFavouriteBand = "AC/DC"

def getBandRating(bandname):
    myFavouriteBand = "Deep Purple"
    if bandname == myFavouriteBand:
        return 10.0
    else:
        return 0.0

print("AC/DC's rating is:",getBandRating("AC/DC"))
print("Deep Purple's rating is: ",getBandRating("Deep Purple"))
print("My favourite band is:",myFavouriteBand)

<h2 id ="collec"> Collections and Functions</h2>

When the number of arguments  are unknown for a function, They can all be packed into a tuple as shown:

def printAll(*args): # All the arguments are 'packed' into args which can be treated like a tuple
    print("No of arguments:", len(args)) 
    for argument in args:
        print(argument)
#printAll with 3 arguments
printAll('Horsefeather','Adonis','Bone')
#printAll with 4 arguments
printAll('Sidecar','Long Island','Mudslide','Carriage')
Similarly, The arguments can also be packed into a dictionary as shown:

def printDictionary(**args):
    for key in args:
        print(key + " : " + args[key])

printDictionary(Country='Canada',Province='Ontario',City='Toronto')
    
Functions can be incredibly powerful and versatile. They can accept (and return) data types, objects and even other functions as arguements. Consider the example below:

def addItems(list):
    list.append("Three")
    list.append("Four")

myList = ["One","Two"]

addItems(myList)

myList
    
Note how the changes made to the list are not limited to the functions scope. This occurs as it is the lists **reference** that is passed to the function - Any changes made are on the orignal instance of the list. Therefore, one should be cautious when passing mutable objects into functions.
