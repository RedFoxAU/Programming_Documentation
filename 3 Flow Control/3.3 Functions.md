## Functions

A function is a reusable block of code which performs operations specified in the function. Functions allow tasks to be broken into smaller pieces and for the code to be reused in different programs.

*[Code](/XXCode%20Snips/3.3.3%20Pascal's%20Fucking%20Triangle.py) for Pascal's Triangle utilising functions*

There are two types of functions :
* **Pre-defined functions** and  
* **User defined functions**

___
### Pre-defined functions

There are many pre-defined functions in Python, some common and well-known ones include the [`print()`](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.1%20Hello%20World.md#print-formatting), `sum()`, and `len()` functions.
Some require importing such as [math or random](/XXCode%20Snips/3.3.1%20Modules%20and%20Libraries.py)

In Python, an in-built function is a pre-defined function that is always available for use, providing common functionality without requiring any imports. 

### User Defined Functions

The basic structure of a user defined function is:
* Functions blocks begin `def`Â followed by the function `name` and parentheses `()`.
* Input parameters or arguments should be placed within the parentheses.
* Preameters may also be defined within the parentheses.
* There is a body within every function that starts with a colon (`:`) and is indented.
* Documentation can be placed before the body.
* The statement `return` exits a function, optionally passing back a value.

*[Code](/XXCode%20Snips/3.3.2%20Functions.py) for examples of user-created functions*

Below is an example of a function that adds on to the parameter `a` prints and returns the output as `b`:
```py
# First function example: Add 1 to a and store as b
def add(a):
    """
    add 1 to a
    """
    b = a + 1
    print(a, "if you add one", b)
    return(b)
```

Help can be obtained about a function; this will call the documentation within the function.
```py
help(add)
```

Will output:
```
Help on function add in module __main__:

add(a)
    add 1 to a
```

Functions can be called
```py
add(1)
```

Will output:
```
1 if you add one 2
```

If the function is called with a new input, a different result is obtained.
```py
add(2)
```

Will output:
```
2 if you add one 3
```

Functions can be used to call other functions. For example, a function can be created that multiplies two numbers, using the ouput `b` of the 'add' function. The numbers will be represented by the variables `a` and `b`:
```py
def add(a):
    """
    add 1 to a
    """
    b = a + 1
    print(a, "if you add one", b)
    return(b)

def Mult(a, b):
    c = a * b
    return(c)
    print('This is not printed')
    
result = Mult(2, add(1))
print(result)
```

Will output:
```
1 if you add one 2
4
```

Note how the function terminates at the `return` statement, while passing back a value. This value can be further assigned to a different variable as desired.  

The same function can be used for different data types. For example, two integers can be mutiplied
```py
Mult(2, 3)
```

Will output:
```
6
```

or two floats:
```py
Mult(10.0, 3.14)
```

Will output:
```
31.400000000000002
```

A [string](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.4%20String%20Operations.md#concatenation) can be replicated by multiplying with an integer:
```py
# Use mult() multiply two different type values together
Mult(2, "String")
```

Will output:
```
StringString
```

___
## Variables

The input to a function is called a formal parameter.

The scope of a variable is the part of that program where that variable is accessible. A variable that is declared inside a function is called a  local variable. The parameter only exists within the function (i.e. the point where the function starts and stops).

A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout the program.

If a variable is defined twice, both within and outside a function, the local variable will take precedence within the function, but the global variable will be returned if referred to outside the function.
```py
def square(a):   
    b = 1 # Local variable b
    c = a * a + b
    print(a, "if you square + 1", c) 
    return(c)

x = 3 # Initializes Global variable  
y = square(x) # Makes function call and return function a y
y
```

Will output:
```
3 if you square + 1 10
```

**Note:**  
If there is no `return` statement, the function returns `None`. 

___
### Default Arguments

Default arguments can be set for functions. In the example below, in the `isGoodRating()` function, a default thresh hold for a "good" rating is set to 4:
```py
def isGoodRating(rating=4): 
    if(rating < 7):
        print("this album sucks its rating is",rating)
        
    else:
        print("this album is good its rating is",rating)

# Test the value with default value and with input
isGoodRating()
isGoodRating(10)
```

Will output:
```
this album sucks its rating is 4
this album is good its rating is 10
```

___
## Collections and Functions

When the number of arguments are unknown for a function, They can all be packed into a tuple:
```py
def printAll(*args): # All the arguments are 'packed' into args which is treated like a tuple
    print("No. of arguments:", len(args)) 
    for argument in args:
        print(argument)
#printAll with 3 arguments
printAll('Horsefeather','Adonis','Bone')
#printAll with 4 arguments
printAll('Sidecar','Long Island','Mudslide','Carriage')
```

Will output:
```
No. of arguments: 3
Horsefeather
Adonis
Bone
No. of arguments: 4
Sidecar
Long Island
Mudslide
Carriage
```

Similarly, The arguments can also be packed into a dictionary:
```py
def printDictionary(**args):
    for key in args:
        print(key + " : " + args[key])

printDictionary(Country='Canada',Province='Ontario',City='Toronto')
```

Will output:
```
Country : Canada
Province : Ontario
City : Toronto
```

Functions can be incredibly powerful and versatile. They can accept (and return) data types, objects and even other functions as arguements. Consider the example below:
```py
def addItems(list):
    list.append("Three")
    list.append("Four")

myList = ["One","Two"]
addItems(myList)
print(myList)
```

Will output:
```
['One', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four']
```

Note how the changes made to the list are not limited to the functions scope. This occurs as it is the lists **reference** that is passed to the function - Any changes made are on the orignal instance of the list. Therefore, one should be cautious when passing mutable objects into functions.

___
## Conditionals and Loops in Functions

The `return()` function is particularly useful if you have any `if` statements in the function, when the output is to be dependent on some condition:
```py
def type_of_album(artist, album, year_released):   
    print(artist, album, year_released)
    if year_released > 1980:
        return "Modern"
    else:
        return "Oldie"
    
x = type_of_album("Michael Jackson", "Thriller", 1980)
print(x)
```

Will output:
```
Michael Jackson Thriller 1980
Oldie
```

Loops can also be used in a function, for example to print out elements of a list.
```py
def PrintList(the_list):
    for element in the_list:
        print(element)

PrintList(['1', 1, 'the man', "abc"])
```

Will output:
```
1
1
the man
abc
```

## String Comparison in Functions  

Relational operators compare the Unicode values of the characters of the strings from the zeroth index till the end of the string. It then returns a boolean value according to the operator used.
```py
def check_string(text):
    if text in string:
        return 'String matched'
    else:
        return 'String not matched'

string= "Michael Jackson is the best"

print(check_string("Michael Jackson is the best"))
```

Will output:
```
String matched
```

Below is an example of a user-defined function `compareStrings()` Which compares two strings. It receives both strings as its argument and returns 1 if both strings are equal using `==` the operator
```py
def compareStrings(x, y):
    if x==y:
        return 1
    
string1 = "Michael Jackson is the best"
string2 = "Michael Jackson is the best"

check = compareStrings(string1, string2)

if check==1:
    print("\nString Matched")
else:
    print("\nString not Matched")
```

Will output:
```
String Matched
```

Below is an example fo a user-defined function that will count the frequency of the worrds appearing in a string using a dictionary.Count the Frequency of Words Appearing in a String Using a Dictionary.
```py
def freq(string):
    words = []
    words = string.split() # or string.lower().split()
    Dict = {}
    for key in words:
        Dict[key] = words.count(key)
    print("The Frequency of words is:",Dict)
    
freq("Mary had a little lamb Little lamb, little lamb Mary had a little lamb.Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went Mary went, Mary went Everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go")
```

Will output:
```
The Frequency of words is: {'Mary': 6, 'had': 2, 'a': 2, 'little': 3, 'lamb': 3, 'Little': 1, 'lamb,': 1, 'lamb.Its': 1, 'fleece': 1, 'was': 2, 'white': 1, 'as': 1, 'snow': 1, 'And': 1, 'everywhere': 1, 'that': 2, 'went': 3, 'went,': 1, 'Everywhere': 1, 'The': 1, 'sure': 1, 'to': 1, 'go': 1}
```
