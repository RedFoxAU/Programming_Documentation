##  The two tenets of coding are:
##  1: "Esoteric languages are a joke thing. No one should ever use them"
##  2: "Solving code challenges using excel spreadsheets counts as an esoteric language"

# 1. Nested Loops:
# Introduction:
# Nested loops involve using one or more loops inside another loop. They are useful for iterating through combinations of elements in nested data structures.
# Task 1: Simple Matrix Print
# Print a 3x3 matrix using nested loops.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Basic loop syntax and iterating through 2D arrays.


# Task 2: Multiplication Table
# Print the multiplication table for numbers 1 to 5 using nested loops.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Nested loop logic and arithmetic operations.


# Task 3: Triangular Pattern
# Print a triangular pattern using nested loops.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Nested loops for patterns and logic.




# 2. String Formatting:
# Introduction:
# String formatting involves creating formatted strings with placeholders for dynamic values. It helps enhance the visual presentation of information.
# Task 1: Basic String Interpolation
# Print a sentence with placeholders for a name and an age.
# Suggested Areas of Study: String concatenation and placeholders.


# Task 2: Decimal Precision
# Print a floating-point number with a specific number of decimal places.
# Suggested Areas of Study: String formatting options for precision.


# Task 3: Table Formatting
# Create a table-like format for a list of items using string formatting.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Aligning columns and creating visually appealing output.





# 3. Mathematical Patterns:
# Introduction:
# Mathematical patterns involve creating sequences or structures based on mathematical rules or formulas.
# Task 1: Number Pyramid
# Print a pyramid of numbers following a specific pattern.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Basic arithmetic patterns.


# Task 2: Fibonacci Sequence
# Generate the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Understanding and implementing the Fibonacci sequence.


# Task 3: Prime Numbers
# Print the first 15 prime numbers.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Implementing algorithms for prime number generation.





# 4. Nested Lists and Comprehensions:
# Introduction:
# Nested lists and comprehensions involve creating and manipulating lists within lists using concise syntax.
# Task 1: Flattening a Matrix
# Write a function to flatten a 2D matrix into a single list using nested comprehensions.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Understanding list comprehensions and nested structures.



# Task 2: Transposing a Matrix
# Write a function to transpose a 2D matrix using nested comprehensions.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Working with nested structures and comprehension logic.



# Task 3: Filtering a Matrix
# Filter a matrix to include only even numbers using nested comprehensions.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Conditional comprehensions and filtering.





# Combining Tasks:
# Task: Matrix Formatting
# Generate a matrix and print it with proper formatting, combining nested loops, string formatting, and nested lists.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Combining concepts from nested loops, string formatting, and nested lists.


# Task: Pattern with Data
# Create a pattern based on prime numbers and print it with proper formatting, combining mathematical patterns and string formatting.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Integrating patterns with data and formatting.

# Task: Advanced Matrix Operations
# Perform advanced operations on a matrix, combining nested loops, mathematical patterns, and nested lists.
# Suggested Areas of Study: Advanced matrix manipulations and nested comprehensions.
