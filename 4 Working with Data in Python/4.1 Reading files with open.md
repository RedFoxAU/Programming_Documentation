## Reading Files

One way to read or write a file in Python is to use the built-in `open` function. The `open` function provides a **File object** that contains the methods and attributes you need in order to read, save, and manipulate the file. In this notebook, we will only cover **.txt** files. The first parameter you need is the file path and the file name. An example is shown as follow:

The mode argument is optional and the default value is **r**. In this notebook we only cover two modes:

<ul>
    <li>**r**: Read mode for reading files </li>
    <li>**w**: Write mode for writing files</li>
</ul>

For the next example, we will use the text file **Example1.txt**. The file is shown as follows:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%204/images/ReadFile.png" width="100">

We read the file:
```py
# Read the Example1.txt
example1 = "example1.txt"
file1 = open(example1, "r")
```

We can view the attributes of the file.

The name of the file:
```py
# Print the path of file

file1.name
```

The mode the file object is in:
```py
# Print the mode of file, either 'r' or 'w'

file1.mode
```

We can read the file and assign it to a variable :
```py
# Read the file

FileContent = file1.read()
FileContent
```

The **/n** means that there is a new line.

We can print the file:
```py
# Print the file with '\n' as a new line

print(FileContent)
```

The file is of type string:
```py
# Type of file content

type(FileContent)
```

It is very important that the file is closed in the end. This frees up resources and ensures consistency across different python versions.
```py
# Close file after finish

file1.close()
```

## Reading With with open()

Using the `with` statement is better practice, it automatically closes the file even if the code encounters an exception. The code will run everything in the indent block then close the file object.
```py
# Open file using with

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    FileContent = file1.read()
    print(FileContent)
```

The file object is closed, you can verify it by running the following cell:
```py
# Verify if the file is closed

file1.closed
```

We can see the info in the file:
```py
# See the content of file

print(FileContent)
```

The syntax is a little confusing as the file object is after the `as` statement. We also don’t explicitly close the file. Therefore we summarize the steps in a figure:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%204/images/ReadWith.png" width="500">

## Reading Partial File Content
We don’t have to read the entire file, for example, we can read the first 4 characters by entering three as a parameter to the method **.read()**:
```py
# Read first four characters

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(4))
```

Once the method `.read(4)` is called the first 4 characters are called. If we call the method again, the next 4 characters are called. The output for the following cell will demonstrate the process for different inputs to the method `read()`:
```py
# Read certain amount of characters

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(4))
    print(file1.read(7))
    print(file1.read(15))
```

The process is illustrated in the below figure, and each color represents the part of the file read after the method `read()` is called:

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%204/images/read.png" width="500">

Here is an example using the same file, but instead we read 16, 5, and then 9 characters at a time:
```py
# Read certain amount of characters

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.read(16))
    print(file1.read(5))
    print(file1.read(9))
```

We can also read one line of the file at a time using the method `readline()`:
```py
# Read one line

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print("first line: " + file1.readline())
```

We can also pass an argument to ` readline() ` to specify the number of charecters we want to read. However, unlike ` read()`, ` readline()` can only read one line at most.
```py
with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    print(file1.readline(20)) # does not read past the end of line
    print(file1.read(20)) # Returns the next 20 chars
```

We can use a loop to iterate through each line:
```py
# Iterate through the lines

with open(example1,"r") as file1:
        i = 0;
        for line in file1:
            print("Iteration", str(i), ": ", line)
            i = i + 1
```

We can use the method `readlines()` to save the text file to a list:
```py
# Read all lines and save as a list

with open(example1, "r") as file1:
    FileasList = file1.readlines()
```

Each element of the list corresponds to a line of text:
```py
# Print the first line

FileasList[0]
# Print the second line

FileasList[1]
# Print the third line

FileasList[2]
```


**Task 13: File Handling**  
Write a script that reads the contents of a text file, counts the occurrences of each word, and prints the word frequencies. You can use the text of a short story or any text file for testing.
