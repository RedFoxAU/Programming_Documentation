### Raspi Audio issues
I have a raspberry pi running raspi os lite (fresh install) connected to a tv via hdmi.
I am trying to get sound to play through the tv. I have installed asla-utils and pulse-audio, and everything it updated/upgraded to the latest versions. 

I am fairly new to linux os's, especially minimal ones like this,  can you help me troubleshoot and get the sound working?

Please provide only one step at a time so that if there are any errors we can discuss.
ChatGPT

Absolutely, let's start with some basic checks and configurations. Since you've already installed alsa-utils and pulse-audio, let's proceed step by step.
Step 1: Check HDMI Configuration

First, let's ensure that the Raspberry Pi is configured to use the HDMI output for audio.

    Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi.

    Edit the config.txt file to set HDMI as the audio output:

    bash

sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Add or uncomment the following lines to force HDMI output:

plaintext

hdmi_force_hotplug=1
hdmi_drive=2

    hdmi_force_hotplug=1 ensures HDMI is used even if no HDMI monitor is detected.
    hdmi_drive=2 ensures HDMI audio output.

Save the file and exit by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, and Enter.

Reboot your Raspberry Pi to apply these changes:

bash

    sudo reboot

Once your Raspberry Pi has rebooted, test to see if the audio works. You can use a simple command to play a test sound:

bash

aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

If there are any issues or if this step does not resolve the problem, let me know and we can proceed to the next troubleshooting step.
# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
dtparam=audio=on
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
hdmi_drive=2
ChatGPT

Great, it looks like the relevant configuration parameters are correctly set in your config.txt. Now, let's proceed to check the sound settings and ensure that the HDMI output is selected.
Step 2: Set HDMI as the Default Audio Output

1
My config file looks like this:

# Enable audio (loads snd_bcm2835)
dtparam=audio=on
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
hdmi_drive=2


After the reboot, when I logged in I got a series of error messages relating to the audio:
"Uanble to map audio" and something about Asoc
ChatGPT

The error messages you're seeing indicate that there might be an issue with the ALSA sound system. Let's proceed by checking the status of your audio devices and ensuring that the correct modules are loaded.
Step 2: Check and Configure Audio Devices

    Check ALSA for Audio Devices:

    Open a terminal and run:

    bash

aplay -l

This command lists all playback hardware devices. You should see entries related to HDMI and possibly the onboard audio device.

Ensure snd_bcm2835 Module is Loaded:

Check if the snd_bcm2835 module (which handles audio for the Raspberry Pi) is loaded:

bash

lsmod | grep snd_bcm2835

If you don't see any output, it means the module is not loaded. Load it manually:

bash

sudo modprobe snd_bcm2835

Verify PulseAudio is Running:

Ensure that PulseAudio is running:

bash

pulseaudio --check

If there's no output, PulseAudio is running. If you get an error, start it manually:

bash

pulseaudio --start

Set HDMI as the Default Audio Output in PulseAudio:

Open the PulseAudio volume control (if installed):

bash

pavucontrol

In the Output Devices tab, ensure HDMI is selected as the output. If pavucontrol is not installed, install it with:

bash

sudo apt-get install pavucontrol

Test Audio Playback:

After ensuring the above settings are correct, test audio playback again:

bash

    aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

If Issues Persist:

    Check for Errors in System Logs:

    Check the system logs for any relevant error messages:

    bash

dmesg | grep snd

Update and Upgrade Packages:

Ensure your system is fully updated:

bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Please proceed with these steps and let me know if you encounter any issues or if any particular step fails. This will help us diagnose and fix the problem.

ChatGPT

Thanks for the detailed information. It seems like the ALSA devices are correctly detected, and the snd_bcm2835 module is loaded properly. Let's now proceed with setting the correct audio output device using ALSA.
Step 3: Set HDMI as the Default Audio Output Using ALSA

    Create or Edit the .asoundrc File:

    We'll create or edit the .asoundrc configuration file in your home directory to set HDMI as the default audio output.

    bash

nano ~/.asoundrc

Add the Following Configuration to .asoundrc:

Paste the following content into the file:

plaintext

pcm.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
  device 0
}

ctl.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
}

This configuration sets the default PCM and control devices to use card 1 (which corresponds to vc4-hdmi according to your aplay -l output).

Save and Exit the Editor:

Save the file and exit by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, and Enter.

Test Audio Playback:

Try playing a test sound again:

bash

    aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

Please perform these steps and let me know if the audio works or if there are any errors.
I was unable to install pauvcontrol: E: Unable to locate package pauvcontrol
ChatGPT

It seems there was a typo in the package name. The correct package name is pavucontrol. Let's correct that and then proceed with testing the audio settings.
Step 3: Install pavucontrol

    Install pavucontrol:

    bash

sudo apt-get install pavucontrol

Run pavucontrol to Set HDMI as the Default Output:

Once installed, you can run:

bash

pavucontrol

Select HDMI as the Default Output:

In the PulseAudio Volume Control window that opens:

    Go to the "Output Devices" tab.
    Make sure HDMI is selected as the output device.

Test Audio Playback:

After setting HDMI as the default output, test the audio:

bash

    aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

If pavucontrol is successfully installed and configured but the audio still doesn't work, we can proceed with checking and setting up ALSA configurations as mentioned previously.
I have installed pavucontrol, when trying to run it I get the following error:

Gtk-WARNING **: 16:10:17.856: cannot open display: localhost:10.0

ChatGPT

The error message indicates that the GUI cannot open because the display isn't set correctly. Since you're running a headless setup with raspi os lite, you need to use a method to forward the display or run the commands locally on a machine with a desktop environment.

However, for our purposes, we can use alsa-utils to configure the audio settings without needing a GUI.
Step 4: Set HDMI as the Default Audio Output Using ALSA (No GUI)

    Create or Edit the .asoundrc File:

    We'll create or edit the .asoundrc configuration file in your home directory to set HDMI as the default audio output.

    bash

nano ~/.asoundrc

Add the Following Configuration to .asoundrc:

Paste the following content into the file:

plaintext

pcm.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
  device 0
}

ctl.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
}

This configuration sets the default PCM and control devices to use card 1 (which corresponds to vc4-hdmi according to your aplay -l output).

Save and Exit the Editor:

Save the file and exit by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, and Enter.

Test Audio Playback:

Try playing a test sound again:

bash

    aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

If you still face issues, we can check the status of PulseAudio and try to configure it without using pavucontrol.
Step 5: Ensure PulseAudio is Running Correctly

    Restart PulseAudio:

    bash

pulseaudio --kill
pulseaudio --start

List PulseAudio Sinks:

Ensure that the HDMI output is recognized by PulseAudio:

bash

pactl list sinks short

Look for a sink related to HDMI.

Set the Default Sink:

Once you have the sink name for HDMI, set it as the default:

bash

    pactl set-default-sink <sink_name>

    Replace <sink_name> with the actual name of the HDMI sink.

Please proceed with these steps and let me know the outcome or any issues you encounter.
Thank you. The sound now works when I use the test sounds. For the next step, I want to be able to hear sounds from a remote connection I've set up with my Windows PC. I've already set that up so it connects to my desktop okay, but I don't seem to be able to get sound coming through from the remote connection.
I should have said, I'm trying to connect to my Windows PC from the Raspberry Pi. I've set that up via using xutils and have set up a
ChatGPT

Great to hear that the test sounds are working! For enabling sound from a remote Windows PC to the Raspberry Pi, youâ€™ll need to ensure that sound forwarding is configured correctly. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:
Step 6: Enable Sound Forwarding with Remote Desktop

    Install rdesktop or freerdp:

    Ensure you have an RDP client that supports sound forwarding. freerdp is a good option.

    bash

sudo apt-get install freerdp2-x11

Connect with Sound Forwarding:

Use freerdp to connect to your Windows PC with sound forwarding enabled. Hereâ€™s the command:

bash

xfreerdp /v:<Windows_PC_IP> /u:<username> /p:<password> +audio

Replace <Windows_PC_IP>, <username>, and <password> with your actual connection details.

Verify Sound Settings in Windows:

Ensure that sound settings in your Windows RDP session are configured to allow sound to play on the remote machine. You can check this in the Remote Desktop settings under the "Local Resources" tab before connecting.

Adjust PulseAudio Configuration:

If the above steps don't work, ensure that PulseAudio is configured to accept sound from remote sources.

Edit PulseAudio Configuration:

bash

sudo nano /etc/pulse/default.pa

Add or uncomment the following lines:

plaintext

load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-anonymous=1
load-module module-zeroconf-publish

Save the file and restart PulseAudio:

bash

    pulseaudio --kill
    pulseaudio --start

    Re-connect and Test Sound:

    After making these changes, try reconnecting to your Windows PC using xfreerdp and test the sound again.

Please try these steps and let me know if you encounter any issues or if the sound forwarding works.
Whenever I started PulseAudio, I started getting a series of errors that says HDMI audio codec, HDMI audio codec 0.auto, not able to map channels to speakers, dash 22, and ASOC, error at SND, SOC, PCM, DAI, prepare, on i2, hi-fi, and no sound is playing.
ChatGPT

It sounds like PulseAudio is having conflicts with the ALSA settings or the HDMI audio configuration. Let's try resolving this by focusing on the ALSA configuration first and ensuring that PulseAudio doesn't interfere.
Step 7: Configure ALSA Exclusively and Disable PulseAudio

    Disable PulseAudio Autostart:

    Let's disable PulseAudio from starting automatically. This will help us to troubleshoot and focus on ALSA settings.

    bash

systemctl --user disable pulseaudio.socket
systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.service
systemctl --user mask pulseaudio.socket

Revert to ALSA-only Configuration:

Since PulseAudio is disabled, ensure that the .asoundrc file is configured correctly to use HDMI via ALSA:

bash

nano ~/.asoundrc

Ensure it contains the following:

plaintext

pcm.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
  device 0
}

ctl.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
}

Reboot the Raspberry Pi:

Reboot to ensure all changes take effect:

bash

sudo reboot

Test Audio Playback with ALSA:

After the reboot, try playing a test sound again to ensure that ALSA is correctly outputting to HDMI:

bash

    aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

If the audio plays correctly via ALSA, it confirms the issue lies with PulseAudio configuration. For now, keep PulseAudio disabled to avoid conflicts.
Step 8: Use freerdp with ALSA for Remote Sound

Now, use freerdp to connect to your Windows PC and specify ALSA as the sound system.

    Install freerdp:

    If not already installed:

    bash

sudo apt-get install freerdp2-x11

Connect to Windows with Sound:

Connect using xfreerdp, specifying ALSA for sound forwarding:

bash

    xfreerdp /v:<Windows_PC_IP> /u:<username> /p:<password> /sound:sys:alsa

    Replace <Windows_PC_IP>, <username>, and <password> with your actual connection details.

    Verify Sound Settings in Windows:

    Make sure the Windows Remote Desktop settings are configured to forward sound to the client.

If these steps still result in errors or no sound, we can then consider more advanced PulseAudio configurations or alternative remote desktop solutions. Let me know how this works for you!
I have disabled pulse-audio and rebooted. As soon as the pi restarts I get the same errors, and no sound plays
ChatGPT

Given that disabling PulseAudio didn't resolve the issue and the errors persist, we should take a closer look at the configuration and logs to pinpoint the problem.
Step 9: Check HDMI Audio Configuration and Logs

    Check Current Audio Configuration:

    Let's verify the current audio configuration and ensure ALSA is targeting the correct device.

    List Audio Devices:

    bash

aplay -l

Confirm the output and note the card and device number for HDMI.

Check ALSA Configuration Files:

Ensure system-wide ALSA configuration files don't conflict with our .asoundrc settings.

Check /etc/asound.conf:

bash

sudo nano /etc/asound.conf

Ensure it either matches your .asoundrc or is empty to avoid conflicts. Ideally, it should have:

plaintext

pcm.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
  device 0
}

ctl.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
}

Save and exit if you made any changes.

Inspect System Logs:

Look for specific errors in the system logs related to sound:

bash

dmesg | grep snd

bash

sudo journalctl -xe | grep snd

Note any specific errors or messages.

Update and Reconfigure ALSA:

Reinstall and Reconfigure ALSA:

bash

sudo apt-get install --reinstall alsa-utils
sudo alsactl init

Unmute and Set Volume Levels:

Ensure the sound levels are correctly set and unmuted.

bash

alsamixer

Use the arrow keys to navigate and adjust volumes. Ensure HDMI is selected and not muted (press M to unmute).

Manually Test ALSA Configuration:

Create a minimal ALSA configuration file to directly specify HDMI output:

Create a Test Configuration:

bash

nano ~/.asoundrc

Add the following minimal configuration for direct testing:

plaintext

pcm.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
  device 0
}

ctl.!default {
  type hw
  card 1
}

Save and exit.

Reboot and Test:

Reboot the Raspberry Pi again to ensure all changes take effect:

bash

sudo reboot

After reboot, test the sound playback again:

bash

    aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

Next Steps:

Please perform these steps and let me know the specific errors or messages you find in the logs. This will help us identify if there's a specific driver issue or conflict causing the problem.

ChatGPT

The error logs indicate issues with the HDMI audio codec and the ALSA configuration. The error ASoC: error at snd_soc_pcm_dai_prepare on i2s-hifi: -22 suggests a problem with the sound subsystem configuration, specifically related to HDMI audio.

Let's try a few steps to address these errors:
Step 10: Check Kernel Parameters and Module Options

    Kernel Command Line Parameters:

    The kernel command line indicates conflicting settings for snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi. Ensure that only the correct setting is active:

    Edit the /boot/cmdline.txt file:

    bash

sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

Ensure there is only one snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi parameter, set to 1:

plaintext

coherent_pool=1M 8250.nr_uarts=0 snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=0 snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1 vc_mem.mem_base=0x3ec00000 vc_mem.mem_size=0x40000000 console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=95470fb7-02 rootfstype=ext4 fsck.repair=yes rootwait cfg80211.ieee80211_regdom=AU video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080@60,margin_left=40,margin_right=40,margin_top=30,margin_bottom=30

Save and exit the editor.

Disable snd_soc_hdmi_codec:

This module might be conflicting with snd_bcm2835. Blacklist it:

bash

sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

Add the following line:

plaintext

blacklist snd_soc_hdmi_codec

Save and exit the editor.

Reboot the Raspberry Pi:

Reboot to apply changes:

bash

    sudo reboot

Step 11: Use a Specific Device for HDMI Audio

Create a more explicit ALSA configuration that specifies the HDMI device:

    Edit .asoundrc for Specific Device:

    bash

nano ~/.asoundrc

Replace with the following content:

plaintext

pcm.!default {
    type plug
    slave {
        pcm "hw:1,0"
    }
}

ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 1
}

Save and exit the editor.

Reboot and Test Audio Playback:

Reboot again to ensure all changes take effect:

bash

sudo reboot

After reboot, test the sound playback:

bash

    aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

Step 12: Update and Reinstall ALSA and Firmware

Ensure that your system is fully updated, and reinstall ALSA and the firmware:

    Update the System:

    bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Reinstall ALSA Utilities:

bash

sudo apt-get install --reinstall alsa-utils

Update Firmware:

Update the firmware to the latest version:

bash

sudo rpi-update

Reboot after the firmware update:

bash

    sudo reboot

Please proceed with these steps and let me know if the sound starts working or if the errors persist. This will help us narrow down the issue further.
Can you explain what each of these do?
coherent_pool=1M 8250.nr_uarts=0 snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=0 snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1 vc_mem.mem_base=0x3ec00000 vc_mem.mem_size=0x40000000
ChatGPT

Sure, I can explain each of these kernel parameters:

    coherent_pool=1M:
        This parameter sets the size of the coherent memory pool, which is used for DMA (Direct Memory Access) operations that require memory to be contiguous and consistent between the CPU and devices. 1M sets this pool size to 1 megabyte.

    8250.nr_uarts=0:
        This parameter disables the 8250 UART driver. UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is typically used for serial communication. Setting nr_uarts to 0 means that the 8250 UART driver won't allocate any UART ports.

    snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=0:
        This parameter is used to disable the headphone output for the snd_bcm2835 sound driver. snd_bcm2835 is the ALSA driver for the Broadcom SoC audio, commonly used on Raspberry Pi. Setting it to 0 disables headphone output.

    snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1:
        This parameter is used to enable HDMI audio output for the snd_bcm2835 sound driver. Setting it to 1 ensures that HDMI audio is enabled.

    vc_mem.mem_base=0x3ec00000:
        This parameter sets the base address for the GPU memory. 0x3ec00000 is the memory address where the GPU memory starts.

    vc_mem.mem_size=0x40000000:
        This parameter sets the size of the memory allocated for the GPU. 0x40000000 translates to 1 GB of memory allocated for the GPU.

Summary of Actions

    coherent_pool=1M: Allocates 1 MB for DMA coherent memory.
    8250.nr_uarts=0: Disables 8250 UART ports.
    snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=0: Disables headphone output.
    snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1: Enables HDMI audio output.
    vc_mem.mem_base=0x3ec00000: Sets the GPU memory base address.
    vc_mem.mem_size=0x40000000: Allocates 1 GB for GPU memory.

Conflicts in the Configuration

In your case, the conflicting parameters for snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones and snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi are problematic:

    snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=0 and snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=1: These parameters are contradictory; you should have only one setting.
    snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1 and snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=0: Similarly, these are contradictory and should be resolved to a single setting.

Suggested Actions

    Edit /boot/cmdline.txt to Resolve Conflicts:

    Remove the conflicting parameters so that only the correct ones are left. The adjusted line should look like this:

    plaintext

coherent_pool=1M 8250.nr_uarts=0 snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1 vc_mem.mem_base=0x3ec00000 vc_mem.mem_size=0x40000000 console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty1 root=PARTUUID=95470fb7-02 rootfstype=ext4 fsck.repair=yes rootwait cfg80211.ieee80211_regdom=AU video=HDMI-A-1:1920x1080@60,margin_left=40,margin_right=40,margin_top=30,margin_bottom=30

Blacklist Conflicting Modules (Optional):

As previously mentioned, blacklisting the snd_soc_hdmi_codec module to avoid conflicts can be beneficial:

bash

sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

Add:

plaintext

blacklist snd_soc_hdmi_codec

Reboot and Test:

After making these changes, reboot the Raspberry Pi and test the audio configuration again:

bash

sudo reboot

Test sound playback:

bash

    aplay /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav

Conclusion

These steps should help resolve the configuration conflicts and ensure the HDMI audio is correctly set up. If the issues persist, please provide the updated error logs for further analysis.

 I will add in "snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1" do I need the other parts?
ChatGPT

The current cmdline.txt configuration looks appropriate for booting and configuring the Raspberry Pi. Adding snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1 should help enable HDMI audio. You don't need to include the other conflicting parts (e.g., snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones).

Here's the modified cmdline.txt with snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1 added:

The configuration you've shared in your config.txt file does not appear to be causing a conflict directly. However, there are a few considerations and adjustments you could make based on typical configurations for HDMI audio on Raspberry Pi:
Configuration Analysis:

    Enable Audio Settings:

    plaintext

    dtparam=audio=on
    hdmi_force_hotplug=1
    hdmi_drive=2
    config_hdmi_boost=4

        dtparam=audio=on: This enables audio (loads snd_bcm2835 driver).
        hdmi_force_hotplug=1: Ensures HDMI output is active even if no HDMI display is detected at boot.
        hdmi_drive=2: Sets HDMI mode to HDMI (HDMI mode with sound).
        config_hdmi_boost=4: Increases HDMI signal strength by 4x (useful for longer HDMI cables).

Potential Adjustments:

    Disabling Overscan:
    Since you have disabled overscan (disable_overscan=0), it's recommended to set disable_overscan=1 if you don't need overscan compensation. This adjustment is generally unrelated to HDMI audio but can affect display settings.

    Verify dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d:
    Ensure that dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d is appropriate for your setup. This overlay enables the VC4 (VideoCore IV) graphics driver with KMS (Kernel Mode Setting), which is generally used for video output but could indirectly affect audio in certain configurations.

Troubleshooting Steps:

Given the persistent ASoC errors related to HDMI audio (hdmi-audio-codec hdmi-audio-codec.0.auto: ASoC: error at snd_soc_pcm_dai_prepare on i2s-hifi: -22), here are additional steps to troubleshoot:

    Check dmesg and journalctl Logs:
    Review both dmesg and journalctl logs again to see if there are any new insights into why the ALSA SoC errors persist.

    Recheck ALSA and PulseAudio Configurations:
    Ensure that your ALSA (~/.asoundrc) and PulseAudio (~/.config/pulse/default.pa) configurations are correctly set for HDMI audio. You may need to explicitly configure ALSA to use HDMI as the default device if it's not detected automatically.

    Test with Default config.txt:
    Consider testing with a minimal config.txt (backing up your current one first), containing only the necessary HDMI audio settings (dtparam=audio=on, hdmi_force_hotplug=1, hdmi_drive=2). Sometimes, reducing complexity can help isolate issues.

    Consult Raspberry Pi Community:
    If issues persist after these steps, consider seeking help from the Raspberry Pi community or forums. They may have specific insights or solutions tailored to your Raspberry Pi model and setup.

Conclusion:

While your current config.txt settings for HDMI audio appear appropriate, troubleshooting ALSA SoC errors (ASoC: error at snd_soc_pcm_dai_prepare on i2s-hifi: -22) can be complex. By carefully reviewing logs, verifying configurations, and potentially simplifying your config.txt, you can isolate and resolve the issue causing ALSA errors on your Raspberry Pi.

The persistent ASoC: error at snd_soc_pcm_dai_prepare on i2s-hifi: -22 errors in your logs indicate an issue with configuring the HDMI audio codec (hdmi-audio-codec) on your Raspberry Pi. This error typically points to a problem with initializing or configuring the ALSA System-on-Chip (ASoC) for the HDMI interface.
Troubleshooting Steps:

    Check ALSA Configuration:

    Your .asoundrc configuration seems to be commented out (# symbols present), which means ALSA might default to using PulseAudio (type pulse) instead of directly accessing the hardware (type hw). For HDMI audio, ALSA usually needs direct hardware access.

    Modify your .asoundrc to explicitly configure ALSA to use HDMI as the default device:

    plaintext

pcm.!default {
    type hw
    card 0  # This may need to be adjusted based on your setup
}

ctl.!default {
    type hw
    card 0  # This may need to be adjusted based on your setup
}

Replace card 0 with the appropriate card number if your HDMI audio interface is detected as a different card (card 1, card 2, etc.).

Check config.txt Settings:

Your config.txt settings (dtparam=audio=on, hdmi_force_hotplug=1, hdmi_drive=2, config_hdmi_boost=4) generally seem appropriate for enabling HDMI audio output. Ensure these settings are correctly applied and saved.

Verify ALSA and PulseAudio Services:

After making changes to .asoundrc, restart ALSA and PulseAudio services to apply the new configurations:

bash

    sudo systemctl restart alsa-restore.service
    systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.service

    Review dmesg and journalctl Logs:

    After restarting services, check dmesg and journalctl logs again to see if the ASoC errors persist. Look for any new errors or warnings related to ALSA or HDMI audio initialization.

    Recheck Hardware Connections:

    Ensure that your HDMI cable is securely connected and that your display device supports audio output through HDMI.

    Consider Firmware and Kernel Updates:

    Sometimes, updating the Raspberry Pi firmware and kernel to the latest versions can resolve compatibility issues related to audio and video outputs.

    Consult Raspberry Pi Community:

    If issues persist despite these steps, consider seeking assistance from the Raspberry Pi community forums or online support channels. Others may have encountered similar issues and found specific solutions for your Raspberry Pi model and configuration.

Conclusion:

By ensuring that ALSA is configured correctly to access the HDMI audio device and verifying your config.txt settings, you can troubleshoot and resolve the ASoC errors affecting HDMI audio on your Raspberry Pi. It's essential to systematically check each step and review logs to pinpoint where the configuration or setup might be causing the issue.
I have done all that the alsa config is the way it is, because I'm using pulseaudio, I get ther eorrors regardless of the config file; either way the sound works and I get the errors.

If you're still not getting sound from the remote connection after adjusting settings on both your Windows 10 Pro PC and attempting to connect via xfreerdp from your Raspberry Pi, let's go through some additional troubleshooting steps:
Troubleshooting Steps:

    Verify Remote Audio Settings on Windows 10 Pro:
        Ensure that you have selected the appropriate options for audio redirection in the Remote Desktop settings on your Windows 10 Pro PC. Even though you mentioned not seeing a specific "Remote audio" section, sometimes it might be labeled differently or included under "Local Resources" or "Advanced settings."

    Restart Remote Desktop Services:
        Sometimes, restarting the Remote Desktop Services on the Windows PC can help resolve configuration issues related to audio redirection.
            Open the Services management console by pressing Win + R, typing services.msc, and pressing Enter.
            Locate the "Remote Desktop Services" entry, right-click it, and choose "Restart."

    Check Audio Playback Devices:
        On your Windows 10 Pro PC, check the playback devices to ensure that the correct device is selected for audio output:
            Right-click the speaker icon in the system tray and select "Open Sound settings."
            Under the "Output" section, verify that the correct output device (e.g., speakers or headphones) is selected and that it is not muted.
            Test playing audio locally on the Windows PC to confirm that audio is working correctly.

    Update Audio Drivers:
        Ensure that your audio drivers on the Windows 10 Pro PC are up-to-date. Outdated or corrupted drivers can sometimes cause issues with audio playback during remote desktop sessions.

    Verify Network Connectivity:
        Ensure that both your Raspberry Pi and Windows 10 Pro PC are on the same network and that there are no network issues preventing communication between them.

    Test with Different Remote Desktop Client:
        If xfreerdp continues to have issues with audio redirection, try using a different remote desktop client on your Raspberry Pi (e.g., Remmina, rdesktop) to see if you experience the same problem.

    Check Firewall and Security Software:
        Ensure that any firewall or security software on your Windows 10 Pro PC is not blocking incoming connections or interfering with remote desktop functionality.

    Restart Raspberry Pi:
        Sometimes, restarting your Raspberry Pi can help clear any temporary issues with network connectivity or configuration.

Testing:

    After making adjustments and ensuring everything is set up correctly, attempt to reconnect using xfreerdp from your Raspberry Pi.
    Open an application on the Windows 10 Pro PC that produces sound and verify if you can hear audio through the remote desktop session.

Additional Considerations:

    If you are in a corporate or managed environment, your organization's IT policies and network configurations may impact remote desktop functionality, including audio redirection. Consult with your IT administrator if needed.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the issue with getting sound from your Windows 10 Pro PC during remote desktop sessions initiated from your Raspberry Pi. If the issue persists, it may be beneficial to check system logs on both devices for any relevant error messages that could provide further clues to the problem.
