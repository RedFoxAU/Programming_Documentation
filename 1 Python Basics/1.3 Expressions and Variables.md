## Variables
*Variables are used to store values.*  

The value `1` can be assigned to the variable `my_variable` using the assignment operator (equals sign)
<details><summary>Assign variable</summary>

```py
my_variable = 1
```
</details><p></p>

Variables can be the result of [expressions](#expressions)
<details><summary>Expression variable</summary>

```py
my_variable = 43 + 60 + 16 + 41
```
</details><p></p>

Operations can be performed on variables the result saved to a new variable
<details><summary>New variable from operation on variable</summary>

```py
# Use another variable to store the result of the operation between variable and value 
y = x / 60
```
</details><p></p>

If a value is saved to an existing variable; the new value will overwrite the previous value
  <details><summary>Overwrite variable</summary>
```py
my_variable = my_variable / 60
print(my_variable)
```
</details><p></p>

*It's good practice to use meaningful variable names, to improve code readability and maintainability*

___
### Variables from user input
Variables can be derived from a user input. All variables can then be used elsewhere by recalling the (exact) name of the variable
<details><summary>request and print variable from user input</summary>

```py
# Request User input
name = input("Hi, What's your name? ")

# Recall the variable
print ("Hi",name,"it's nice to meet you, I hope you're having a nice day :)")
```
[Code](<../XXCode Snips/1.3.1 Variables from user input.py>)
</details><p></p>

Will output:  
```
Hi, What's your name? Amanda
Hi Amanda it's nice to meet you, I hope you're having a nice day :)
```

*In Python, variables derived from the `input()` function are treated as a string by default.*  

If comparing a user input variable to numerical values, the input must be converted to an integer using the `int()` function. See [Type Casting](1.2%20Types.md#advanced-type-casting) for more information.  
 
<details><summary><i>See below for an illustration of what happens if input variables are not correctly converted</i></summary>

Script to return an answer depending on a user's input:  

**Incorrect:**
```py
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```
In this case, age is a string. When attempting to compare it with integers using  the `<=` operator, Python throws an error.

To fix this, `age` must be converted to an integer:  
**Correct**  
```py
# Request user input and onvert to integer
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```

This ensures that age is treated as an integer, allowing numerical comparisons without raising a `TypeError`.

___
## Expressions  
*Expressions describe a type of operation that computers perform.*  

Expressions in Python can include operations among compatible types (e.g. integers and floats). For example, basic arithmetic operations  
<details><summary>Addition operation expression</summary>

`43 + 60 + 16 + 41`  
</details>

<details><summary>Subtraction operation expression</summary>
 
`50 - 60`  
</details>

<details><summary>Multiplication operation expression</summary>

`5 * 5`  
</details>

<details><summary>Division operation expression</summary>

`25 / 5`  
</details><p></p>

We can use the double slash for integer division, where the result is rounded down to the nearest integer:  
<details><summary>Integer division operation expression</summary>

`25 // 4`  
</details><p></p>

Python follows mathematical conventions when performing mathematical expressions (*BODMAS*).  

___
### Modulo  
The `%` operator in Python is called the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. For example `3 % 2` will return "1".

A common context in which this is used is checking for odd or even numbers, the modulo operator is used to check if a number is divisible by 2.
<details><summary>Use modulo to test odd or even</summary>

```py
if number % 2 != 0: # Will return True if the number is odd
```
</details><p></p>

[Code](<../XXCode Snips/1.3.3 Even or Odd.py>)  
*See [Loops *Needs update 3.2](/x3%20Python%20Programming%20Fundamentals/x3.2%20Loops.md) for loop information.*

## Advanced Removal Methods
Python offers several ways to remove elements or references to data, depending on the context. These include:

| **Method**           | **Use Case**                                 | **Target**    | **Key Difference**                                                       |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `del`                | Delete references or by key/index            | [L](), [T](), [D]() | Does not return the deleted value. Can delete entire variables, tuples, or dictionary entries.                |
| `remove()`           | Remove specific value                        | [L](), [S]()       | Operates on values, not indices. Throws an error if the value is absent. |
| `pop()`              | Remove and return value                      | L, S, D    | For lists/sets, removes and returns the value. For dictionaries, removes and returns the value for a given key. |
| `clear()`            | Empty the container                          | L, S, D    | Keeps the container, empties its contents. Tuples cannot be emptied, as they are immutable.                         |
| `discard()`          | Remove value (no error)                      | S          | Non-error-throwing when the value is absent.                             |
| `difference_update()`| Remove elements found in another iterable    | S          | Modifies the set in place without returning a value.                     |
| `tuple slicing`      | Create a new tuple without specific elements | T          | Tuples are immutable; slicing creates a new tuple.                       |

### Key:
- **L**: Lists
- **T**: Tuples
- **S**: Sets
- **D**: Dictionaries

### del Statement
The `del` statement can be used with [lists](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#delete), [dictionaries](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.3%20Dictionaries.md#delete) and entire variables. While it cannot delete elements from a [tuple](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#tuples) because tuples are immutabe, it can be used to remove an entire tuple. Delete (unlinke remove) does not return the deleted value.   
The `del` statement deletes a reference to an object, or the reference to the element specified by key/index. if no references remain the object/element is garbage collected.  

___
### remove() Method
The `remove()` method is used specifically on [lists](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#remove), it removes the first occurrence of a specific value from a list. Being a method, `remove()` operates on values in place.  
The `remove()` method will also work on [sets](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.2%20Sets.md#remove), however it's limitation of only removing a single value at a time, and the fact that it will throw a `KeyError` if a value isn't present in the set makes it less preferred.

___
### pop() Method
The `pop()` method is similar to `del()` in that it will remove an element referred to by index/key from a [list](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.1%20Lists%20and%20Tuples.md#pop) or [dictionary](/2%20Python%20Data%20Structures/2.3%20Dictionaries.md#pop), however it will also return the removed element.
What It Does: Removes and returns an element.  
Example:
```py 
# Lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
value = my_list.pop(1)  # Removes element at index 1. Result: [1, 3], value = 2

# Dictionaries
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
value = my_dict.pop("b")  # Removes key 'b'. Result: {"a": 1}, value = 2
```

What It Does: Removes and returns an arbitrary element from a set.
Where It's Used: Only for sets.
Difference from del: Removes an arbitrary element rather than a specified value.
Example:
```py
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
value = my_set.pop()  # Removes and returns any element (e.g., `1`). Result: {2, 3}
```

### clear() Method
What It Does: Removes all elements, leaving the container empty.
Where It's Used: Lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.
Difference from del: clear() empties the container but keeps the variable intact.
Example:
```py 
# Lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.clear()  # Result: []

# Dictionaries
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
my_dict.clear()  # Result: {}
```

### discard() Method

What It Does: Removes a value from a set. If the value doesn't exist, it does nothing (no error).
Where It's Used: Only for sets.
Difference from del: discard() is specific to sets and is non-error-throwing.
Example:
```py 
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_set.discard(2)  # Result: {1, 3}
my_set.discard(4)  # No error, set remains unchanged.
```

### difference_update() Method

```py
## Conversion from Celsius to Farenheit
degree_sign = u"\u00b0"
# Request input
temp = input ("What is the Celsius temperature that you would like to convert to Fahrenheit? ")

# Convert input temp to float
float_temp = float(temp)

# Convert the temp into farenheight
farenheit = (9/5) * float_temp + 32 

# Print the tempertaure in farenheight
print (temp, degree_sign, "C Is " ,farenheit ,degree_sign,"F")
