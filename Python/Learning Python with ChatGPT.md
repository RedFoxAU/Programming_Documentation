# Learning Python with ChatGPT

## Overview
I asked GPT to act as a teacher and teach me python from beginner to advanced, below is the prompt and it's response, this has been turned into an index of what I have learned, including links to code and side notes where appropriate (mostly from GPT conversations)

The original prompt was:
_Can you create a coding mentorship catered for my continuous learning development, focused on Python. Please create a guide from beginner concepts to advanced concepts, briefly explain what we will learn in each section. Please note I am a complete beginner at both Python and coding._
