You're doing great! Understanding the distinctions between concepts like functions, methods, and statements is key to becoming comfortable with Python. There are a few more essential concepts and distinctions that will further deepen your understanding of the language and programming in general:
1. Expressions vs. Statements

    Expression: A combination of values, variables, and operators that results in a value. An expression always returns a value.
        Example:

    x = 5 + 3  # '5 + 3' is an expression that results in 8

Statement: A command that performs an action but doesn't return a value. It might use expressions, but the statement itself does not evaluate to a value.

    Example:

        if x > 3:  # This is a statement, the condition 'x > 3' is an expression
            print("Greater than 3")  # Print is a statement too

Difference:

    An expression returns a value (like a mathematical calculation).
    A statement performs an action (like assigning a value or printing something).

2. Local vs. Global Scope

    Local Scope: Variables defined inside a function or block are local to that function. They are only accessible within that function.
        Example:

    def func():
        x = 10  # x is local to func
        print(x)

    func()  # prints 10
    print(x)  # This will cause an error because x is not accessible outside func

Global Scope: Variables defined outside any function or block are global and accessible throughout the program, including inside functions (unless shadowed).

    Example:

        x = 20  # global x

        def func():
            print(x)  # This will print the global x

        func()  # prints 20

Important: You can modify global variables inside a function with the global keyword, but it's often best to limit the use of global variables for cleaner code.
3. Immutable vs. Mutable Types

    Immutable types (e.g., int, float, str, tuple) cannot be changed after creation. If you modify an immutable object, a new object is created.
        Example:

    x = 5
    x += 1  # Creates a new object, x now points to 6

Mutable types (e.g., list, dict, set) can be changed in place. Modifications will affect the original object.

    Example:

        x = [1, 2, 3]
        x.append(4)  # The list 'x' is modified in place

Key Point: When passing mutable objects to functions, changes made to them inside the function affect the original object. Immutable objects, however, do not.
4. Classes and Objects

    A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines properties (attributes) and methods that the objects can use.
    An object is an instance of a class, and each object has its own set of data, but it follows the structure of the class.

Example:

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

dog1 = Dog("Buddy")  # Creating an object (instance) of Dog
dog1.bark()  # Calls the method bark() on the dog1 object

    Methods are functions defined inside a class and act on instances of that class. In contrast, functions are independent blocks of code, not tied to a class.

5. Lambdas (Anonymous Functions)

    Lambda functions are small, unnamed functions defined using the lambda keyword. They're often used when you need a simple function for a short period of time.

Example:

square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(4))  # Outputs 16

Important: Lambdas can only contain one expression and are useful in places where defining a whole function might be overkill, like in map() or filter().
6. Decorators

    Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods. They are commonly used for logging, access control, caching, etc.

Example:

def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something before the function.")
        func()
        print("Something after the function.")
    return wrapper

@decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()  # Outputs:
# Something before the function.
# Hello!
# Something after the function.

Key Concept: Decorators are used to extend or alter the functionality of a function without modifying its structure directly.
7. Generators and Iterators

    Generators: Functions that yield values one at a time, instead of returning them all at once. They're useful for working with large data sets efficiently, as they generate values on the fly.

Example:

def count_up_to(max):
    count = 1
    while count <= max:
        yield count
        count += 1

for num in count_up_to(5):
    print(num)  # Prints numbers from 1 to 5, one by one

    Iterators: Any object that implements the __iter__() and __next__() methods. Generators are a type of iterator.

Key Point: Generators are memory-efficient and work well for lazy evaluation (processing items one at a time as needed).
8. Exceptions (Error Handling)

    Exceptions allow you to handle errors gracefully rather than letting your program crash. You can catch exceptions using try, except, and optionally else and finally.

Example:

try:
    x = 1 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
else:
    print("Division succeeded.")
finally:
    print("This will always run.")

Key Concept: Use exceptions to handle unexpected errors and to ensure that necessary clean-up actions happen regardless of errors (e.g., closing files, releasing resources).
In Summary: More Concepts to Be Aware Of

    Expressions (return values) vs. Statements (perform actions)
    Local vs. Global Scope of variables
    Immutable vs. Mutable types
    Classes and Objects for organizing code with OOP principles
    Lambdas for quick, unnamed functions
    Decorators for modifying function behavior
    Generators and Iterators for memory-efficient looping
    Exceptions for handling errors gracefully

These distinctions will give you a deeper understanding of how to organize and control your Python programs. They’ll also help you write cleaner, more efficient code as you advance in your learning!

The collection of ideas and constructs you've mentioned—functions, methods, statements, classes, expressions, scopes, exceptions, and so on—can generally be referred to as "programming constructs" or "programming concepts."

However, more specifically, depending on the context, you might use one of these terms:
1. Programming Concepts

    A broad term that refers to the underlying ideas and principles of programming, like how data is structured, how control flow works, how errors are handled, etc.

2. Language Features

    This refers to specific elements provided by a programming language (like Python), such as data types, operators, loops, and functions.

3. Programming Paradigms

    This refers to different styles or approaches to programming, such as procedural, object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming. It includes constructs like classes, methods, and lambda functions that shape how we write programs.

4. Program Structure

    This refers to how the code is organized and how different elements like functions, statements, and loops interact with each other to form a coherent program.

5. Syntax and Semantics

    Syntax refers to the structure and rules that govern the writing of valid code (e.g., how to write a for-loop).
    Semantics refers to the meaning and behavior of those structures in the program (e.g., what happens when the loop runs).

6. Control Structures

    This includes elements that control the flow of execution in a program, such as loops, conditionals, and function calls.

7. Data Structures

    This refers to ways of organizing and storing data (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets, classes).

If you want to refer to this whole collection in general, "programming concepts" is a safe and commonly understood umbrella term. If you're discussing the different tools available in a language, "language features" works well too.
