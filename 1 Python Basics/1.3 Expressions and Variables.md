### Variables
*Variables are used to store values.*  

The value `1` can be assigned to the variable `my_variable` using the assinment operator (equals sign): 
```py
my_variable = 1
```

Variables can be the result of [expressions](#expressions) such as: 
```py
my_variable = 43 + 60 + 16 + 41
```

We can perform operations on variables and save the result to a new variable:  
```py
# Use another variable to store the result of the operation between variable and value 
y = x / 60
```


If a value is saved to an existing variable; the new value will overwrite the previous value:  
```py
my_variable = my_variable / 60
print(my_variable)
```

*It's good practice to use meaningful variable names, to improve code readability and maintainability*
___
### Variables from user input
Variables can be derived from a user input. All variables can then be used elsewhere by recalling the (exact) name of the variable:
```python
# Request User input
name = input("Hi, What's your name? ")

# Recall the variable
print ("Hi",name,"it's nice to meet you, I hope you're having a nice day :)")
```
[Code](<../XXCode Snips/1.3.1 Variables from user input.py>)

Output:
```
Hi, What's your name? Amanda
Hi Amanda it's nice to meet you, I hope you're having a nice day :)
```

*In Python, variables derived from the `input()` function are treated as a string by default.*  

If you're comparing the input to numerical values, you need to convert the input to an integer using the `int()` function. See [Type Casting](1.2%20Types.md#type-casting) for more information.  
 
<details><summary><i>See below for an illustration of what happens if input variables are not correctly converted</i></summary>

Script to return an answer depending on a user's input:  

**Incorrect:**
```python
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```
In this case, age is a string, when attempting to compare it with integers using `<=` Python throws an error.

To fix this, convert age to an integer:  
**Correct**  
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```

This ensures that age is treated as an integer, allowing numerical comparisons without raising a TypeError.

### Expressions  
*Expressions describe a type of operation that computers perform.*  

Expressions in Python can include operations among compatible types (e.g. integers and floats). For example, basic arithmetic operations:  
*Addition operation expression*  
`43 + 60 + 16 + 41`  


*Subtraction operation expression*  
`50 - 60`  
 
*Multiplication operation expression*  
`5 * 5`  
 
*Division operation expression*   
`25 / 5`  

We can use the double slash for integer division, where the result is rounded down to the nearest integer:  
*Integer division operation expression*  
`25 // 4`  

Python follows mathematical conventions when performing mathematical expressions (*BODMAS*).  

___
### Modulo  
The % operator in Python is called the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. For example `3 % 2` will return "1".

A common context in which this is used is checking for odd or even numbers, the modulo operator is used to check if a number is divisible by 2.
```py
if number % 2 != 0: # Will return True if the number is odd
```

### Expressions and Variables Excercises:  
Excercise 1:  
*Write an expression that calculates how many hours there are in 160 minutes*

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```python
160/60

# Or 
160//60
```
</details>

Excercise 2:   
*Create a script that performs basic operations on numbers. Declare two variables (e.g., num1 and num2), and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Print the results.*

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```python
#Define Numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3

## Perform Opertaions
sum_result = num1 + num2
subtract_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
division_result = num1 / num2

#Print results
print ("The numbers are: ", num1, " and ",num2)
print ("Sum is: ", sum_result)
print ("Difference is: ", subtract_result)
print ("Product is: ", product_result)
print ("Division is: ", division_result)
```

Excercise 3: 
*Create a script that takes a temperature in Celsius as user input and converts it to Fahrenheit. The conversion formula is: `F=95Ã—C+32`  
Ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, perform the conversion, and print the result.*  

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```python
## Conversion from Celcius to Farenheit
degree_sign = u"\u00b0"
# Request input
temp = input ("What is the Celcius temperature that you would like to convert to farenheiht? ")

# Convert input temp to float
float_temp = float(temp)

# Convert the temp into farenheight
farenheit = (9/5) * float_temp + 32 

# Print the tempertaure in farenheight
print (temp, degree_sign, "C Is " ,farenheit ,degree_sign,"F")

```
