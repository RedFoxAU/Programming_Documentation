## Conditions and Branching
Conditions and branching are a subset of control flow, which refers to the general execution path of a program. These are the structures that determine what code runs and when.

### Condition Statements
Condition statements are logical structures in programming that evaluate expressions to determine whether specific blocks of code should be executed. They form the basis of decision-making in a program, and will often evaluate to `True` or `False`.

#### Comparison Operators
Comparison operations compare some value or operand and based on a condition, produce a Boolean. When comparing two values you can use these operators:

* **equal:** ==
* **not equal:** !=
* **greater than:** >
* **less than:** <
* **greater than or equal to:** >=
* **less than or equal to:** <=

Below is an example of different tests with condition statements which will evaluate to `True` or `False`: 
```py
a = 5
a == 6 # Test if a = 6
a != 7 # Test if a is NOT equal to 7
a > 5 # Test if a is greater than 5
a < 6 # Test if a is less than 6
a >= 5 # Test if a is greater than OR equal to 5
a <= 6 # Test if a is less than than OR equal to 6
```

Will output:
```
False
True
False
True
True
True
```

The same methods can be applied with [strings](/1%20Python%20Basics/1.4%20String%20Operations.md#strings). The equlaity/inequlity operators can be used to determine if two strings are the same, this includes case sensitivity
```py
"cat" == "dog"
"cat" != "dog"
"cat" == "CAT"
```

Will output:
```
False
True
False
```

The inequality operation is also used to compare the letters/words/symbols according to the ASCII value of letters. The decimal value shown in the following table represents the order of the character:
|**Char.**|ASCII|**Char.**|ASCII|**Char.**|ASCII|**Char.**|ASCII|**Char.**|ASCII|**Char.**|ASCII|

For example, the ASCII code for **!** is 33, while the ASCII code for **+** is 43. Therefore **+** is larger than **!** as 43 is greater than 33.

Similarly, from the table above, the value for **A** is 65, and the value for **B** is 66, therefore:
```py
'B' > 'A'
```

Will output:
```
True
```

When there are multiple letters, the first letter takes precedence in ordering:
```py
# Compare characters
'BA' > 'AB'
```

Will output:
```
True
```

**Note**: Upper Case Letters have different ASCII code than Lower Case Letters, which means the comparison between the letters in Python is case-sensitive.

### Branching
Branching allows different operations to be performed depending on how a condition statement is evaluated using constructs like `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute code selectively.  
This is demonstrated in the [code](/XXCode%20Snips/1.3.3%20Even%20or%20Odd.py) below:
```py
## Even or odd
# Request input (and check it's an integer)
while True:
    try:
        number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        break  # Break out of the loop if input is successfully converted to an integer
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter an integer.")

# Check if Zero
if number == 0:
    print("0 is neither odd nor even")
# Check if odd
elif number % 2 != 0:
    print(number, "is an odd number")
# Check if even
else:
    print(number, "is an even number")
```

### Logical Operators
If it is necessary to check more than one condition at once, logical operators can be used; logical operators allow conditions to be combined or modified, these are:
* `and`
  * The `and` statement is only **True** when both conditions are true.
* `or`
  * The `or` statement is True if one condition, or both are **True**.
* `not`
  * The `not` statement outputs the opposite truth value.

## Condition Statement Exercises

**Exercise 1:**  
There are 2 sisters, Annie and Jane, born in 1996 and 1999 respectively. They want to know who was born in a leap year. Write an if-else statement to determine who was born in a leap year.

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```py
Annie=1996
Jane=1999
if Annie%4 == 0 and Jane %4 == 0:
    print("Both Annie and Jane were born in leap years")
elif Jane%4 == 0:
    print("Jane was born in a leap year")
elif Annie%4 == 0:
    print("Annie was born in a leap year")
else:
    print("Neither Annie or Jane were born in a leap year")
```

Will output:
```
Annie was born in a leap year
```

**Exercise 2:**  
In a school canteen, children under the age of 9 are only given milk porridge for breakfast. Children from 10 to 14 are given a sandwich, and children from 15 to 17 are given a burger. The canteen master asks the age of the student and gives them breakfast accordingly. Sam's age is 10. Use if-else statement to determine what the canteen master will offer to him.

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```python
age = 10
if age < 9:
    print ("You will get a bowl of porridge!")
elif age >= 10 and age <= 14:
    print ("You will get a sandwich!")
elif age >= 15 and age <= 17:
    print("You will get a burger!")
else:
    print("You do not get breakfast!")
```

Will output:
```
You will get a sandwich!
```
