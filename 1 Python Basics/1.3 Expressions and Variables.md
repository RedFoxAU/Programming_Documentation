## Variables
*Variables are used to store values.*  

The value `1` can be assigned to the variable `my_variable` using the assignment operator (equals sign)
<details><summary>Assign variable</summary>

```py
my_variable = 1
```
</details><p></p>

Variables can be the result of [expressions](#expressions)
<details><summary>Expression variable</summary>

```py
my_variable = 43 + 60 + 16 + 41
```
</details><p></p>

Operations can be performed on variables the result saved to a new variable
<details><summary>New variable from operation on variable</summary>

```py
# Use another variable to store the result of the operation between variable and value 
y = x / 60
```
</details><p></p>

If a value is saved to an existing variable; the new value will overwrite the previous value
  <details><summary>Overwrite variable</summary>
```py
my_variable = my_variable / 60
print(my_variable)
```
</details><p></p>

*It's good practice to use meaningful variable names, to improve code readability and maintainability*

___
### Variables from user input
Variables can be derived from a user input. All variables can then be used elsewhere by recalling the (exact) name of the variable
<details><summary>request and print variable from user input</summary>

```py
# Request User input
name = input("Hi, What's your name? ")

# Recall the variable
print ("Hi",name,"it's nice to meet you, I hope you're having a nice day :)")
```
[Code](<../XXCode Snips/1.3.1 Variables from user input.py>)
</details><p></p>

Will output:  
```
Hi, What's your name? Amanda
Hi Amanda it's nice to meet you, I hope you're having a nice day :)
```

*In Python, variables derived from the `input()` function are treated as a string by default.*  

If comparing a user input variable to numerical values, the input must be converted to an integer using the `int()` function. See [Type Casting](1.2%20Types.md#advanced-type-casting) for more information.  
 
<details><summary><i>See below for an illustration of what happens if input variables are not correctly converted</i></summary>

Script to return an answer depending on a user's input:  

**Incorrect:**
```py
age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```
In this case, age is a string. When attempting to compare it with integers using  the `<=` operator, Python throws an error.

To fix this, `age` must be converted to an integer:  
**Correct**  
```py
# Request user input and onvert to integer
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Check age range
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif 18 <= age <= 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```

This ensures that age is treated as an integer, allowing numerical comparisons without raising a `TypeError`.

## Expressions  
*Expressions describe a type of operation that computers perform.*  

Expressions in Python can include operations among compatible types (e.g. integers and floats). For example, basic arithmetic operations  
<details><summary>Addition operation expression</summary>

`43 + 60 + 16 + 41`  
</details>

<details><summary>Subtraction operation expression</summary>
 
`50 - 60`  
</details>

<details><summary>Multiplication operation expression</summary>

`5 * 5`  
</details>

<details><summary>Division operation expression</summary>

`25 / 5`  
</details><p></p>

We can use the double slash for integer division, where the result is rounded down to the nearest integer:  
<details><summary>Integer division operation expression</summary>

`25 // 4`  
</details><p></p>

Python follows mathematical conventions when performing mathematical expressions (*BODMAS*).  

___
### Modulo  
The `%` operator in Python is called the modulo operator. It returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand. For example `3 % 2` will return "1".

A common context in which this is used is checking for odd or even numbers, the modulo operator is used to check if a number is divisible by 2.
<details><summary>Use modulo to test odd or even</summary>

```py
if number % 2 != 0: # Will return True if the number is odd
```
</details><p></p>

[Code](<../XXCode Snips/1.3.3 Even or Odd.py>)  
*See [Loops *Needs update 3.2](/x3%20Python%20Programming%20Fundamentals/x3.2%20Loops.md) for loop information.*

## String Exercises

**Exercise 1:**  
What is the values of the variables `a`, `b` and `c` in the following code?
```py
a = "1"
b = "2"
c = a + b
```
<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```
"1"
"2"
"12"

## Expressions and Variables Exercises:  

**Exercise 1:**  
Write an expression that calculates how many hours there are in 160 minutes

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```py
160/60

# Or 
160//60
```
</details><p></p>

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a script that performs basic operations on numbers. Declare two variables (e.g., num1 and num2), and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Print the results.

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```py
#Define Numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3

## Perform Opertaions
sum_result = num1 + num2
subtract_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
division_result = num1 / num2

#Print results
print ("The numbers are: ", num1, " and ",num2)
print ("Sum is: ", sum_result)
print ("Difference is: ", subtract_result)
print ("Product is: ", product_result)
print ("Division is: ", division_result)
```
[Code](<../XXCode Snips/1.3.4 Numerical Operations.py>) 
</details><p></p>

**Exercise 2:**  
Create a script that takes a temperature in Celsius as user input and converts it to Fahrenheit. The conversion formula is: `F=95Ã—C+32`  
Ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, perform the conversion, and print the result.  

<details><summary>Click here for the solution</summary>

```py
## Conversion from Celsius to Farenheit
degree_sign = u"\u00b0"
# Request input
temp = input ("What is the Celsius temperature that you would like to convert to Fahrenheit? ")

# Convert input temp to float
float_temp = float(temp)

# Convert the temp into farenheight
farenheit = (9/5) * float_temp + 32 

# Print the tempertaure in farenheight
print (temp, degree_sign, "C Is " ,farenheit ,degree_sign,"F")

```
