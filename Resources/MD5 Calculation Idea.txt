NOT PYTHON: MD5 Hash calcuations:

you explained before how MD5's are calculated, but could you maybe show me the step-by-step computation that goes on? lets say I have a text file containing the text "hello", can you show me how I could anually calculate the hash for that?
In fact I even created "hello.txt" which is 5 bytes and has the word hello in it! :)

Manually calculating an MD5 hash is a great learning exercise, but it's a bit of a journey! The algorithm involves multiple complex steps, so let’s break it down into manageable chunks. I'll focus on the high-level process with simple examples, but we can go into more detail if you'd like.
MD5 Overview

MD5 works in several stages:

    Input Preprocessing:
        Pad the input to make its size a multiple of 512 bits (64 bytes).
        Append the original length of the input as a 64-bit value.

    Initialize Constants:
        MD5 uses four 32-bit words (A, B, C, D) initialized to specific values.

    Process in 512-bit Chunks:
        Break the padded input into 512-bit blocks.
        Use a series of bitwise operations (additions, rotations, XORs, etc.) on each block.

    Produce the Final Hash:
        After processing all chunks, the final 128-bit hash is the concatenation of A, B, C, and D.

Step-by-Step for Your "hello.txt"
Step 1: Input Preprocessing

    Binary Representation of "hello":
        Convert "hello" to its ASCII values: 104 101 108 108 111.
        Convert those to binary (8 bits each):
        01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111.

    Total = 40 bits (5 bytes).

    Padding:
        Add a single 1 bit, followed by enough 0 bits to make the length 448 bits (512 - 64).
        After padding:
        01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 10000000 00000000 ... [lots of 0s].

    Append Original Length:
        The original length of "hello" is 40 bits (5 bytes × 8 bits). Represent this as a 64-bit binary value and append it.
        After length appending:
        ... [padded message] ... 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00101000.

    Now the message is exactly 512 bits.

Step 2: Initialize Constants

MD5 initializes the following four 32-bit words:

    A = 0x67452301
    B = 0xEFCDAB89
    C = 0x98BADCFE
    D = 0x10325476

Step 3: Process the Single 512-bit Block

MD5 processes the block using a compression function that involves 64 operations divided into four rounds. Each operation uses:

    A specific mathematical function (F, G, H, or I).
    Predefined constants (known as "sines of integers").
    The block data (split into 16 words of 32 bits each).

For brevity, here's one operation example:

Round 1, Step 1:
F(B, C, D) = (B AND C) OR ((NOT B) AND D)
New A = (A + F + Data[0] + Constant) <<< ShiftAmount

This process repeats for all 64 operations, updating A, B, C, and D.
Step 4: Produce the Final Hash

After processing all blocks:

    Add the final values of A, B, C, and D to their initial values.
    Concatenate the result as a hexadecimal string.

For "hello", the final MD5 hash is:

5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592

How to Manually Verify?

    Use Python: Write a small script to output intermediate steps for verification.
    Online Tools: Compare results from tools like CyberChef or MD5 calculators.
