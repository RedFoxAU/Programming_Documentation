### 3.1 **Conditions and Branching**

Control Flow (if statements):
```python

# Example of if statement
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```



*In this video you will learn about Conditions and Branching.
Comparison operations compare some value or operand, then, based on some condition they
produce a Boolean.
Let's say we assign "a" value of �a� to 6.
We can use the equality operator denoted with two equal signs to determine if two values
are equal, in this case, if seven is equal to 6.
In this case, as six is not equal to 7, the result is false.
If we performed an equality test for the value 6, the two values would be equal.
As a result, we would get a true.
Consider the following equality comparison operator.
If the value of the left operand, in this case, the variable �i� is greater than
the value of the right operand, in this case, 5, the condition becomes true, or else we
get a false.
Let's display some values for "i" on the left.
Let�s see the values greater than 5 in green and the rest in red.
If we set "i" equal to 6, we see that 6 is larger than 5, and as a result, we get a true.
We can also apply the same operations to floats.
If we modify the operator as follows, if the left operand �i� is greater than or equal
to the value of the right operand, in this case, 5, then the condition becomes true.
In this case, we include the value of 5 in the number line and the color changes to green
accordingly.
If we set the value of "i" equal to 5, the operand will produce a true.
If we set the value of �i� to 2, we would get a false because 2 is less than 5.
We can change the inequality, if the value of the left operand, in this case, �i�
is less than the value of right operand, in this case, 6, then condition becomes true.
Again, we can represent this with a colored number line.
The areas where the inequality is true are marked in green and red where the inequality
is false.
If the value for "i" is set to 2, the result is a true, as 2 is less than 6.
The inequality test uses an explanation mark preceding the equal sign, if two operands
are not equal, then the condition becomes true.
We can use a number line.
When the condition is true the corresponding numbers are marked in green and red for where
the condition is false.
If we set �I� equal to 2, the operator is true as 2 is not equal to 6.
We compare strings as well.
Comparing �AC/DC� and �Michael Jackson� using the equality test, we get a false, as
the strings are not the same.
Using the inequality test, we get a true, as the strings are different.
See the labs for more examples.
Branching allows us to run different statements for a different input.
It's helpful to think of an �if statement� as a locked room:
If the statement is true, you can enter the room, and your program can run some predefined
task.
If the statement is false, your program will skip the task.
For example, consider the blue rectangle representing an ACDC concert.
If the individual is 18 or older, they can enter the ACDC concert.
If they are under the age of 18, they cannot enter the concert.
Individual proceeds to the concert, their age is 17, therefore they are not granted
access to the concert, and they must move on.
If the individual is 19, the condition is true, they can enter the concert; then they
can move on.
This is the syntax of the if statement from our previous example.
We have the if statement. We have the expression that can be true or
false, the brackets are not necessary.
We have a colon.
Within an indent, we have the expression that is run if the condition is true.
The statements after the if statement will run regardless if the condition is true or
false.
For the case where the age is 17, we set the value of the variable age to 17.
We check the if statement; the statement is false, therefore the program will not execute
the statement to print "you will enter."
In this case, it will just print �move on.�
For the case where the age is 19, we set the value of the variable age to 19.
We check the if statement.
The statement is true, therefore, the program will execute the statement to print �you
will enter.�
Then it will just print �move on.�
The �else statement� will run a different block of code, if the same condition is false.
Let�s use the ACDC concert analogy again; if the user is 17, they cannot go to the ACDC
concert, but they can go to the Meat Loaf concert represented by the purple square.
If the individual is 19, the condition is true.
They can enter the ACDC concert, then they can move on as before.
The syntax of the else statement is similar.
We simply append the statement else.
We then add the expression we would like to execute with an indent.
For the case where the age is 17, we set the value of the variable age to 17.
We check the if statement.
The statement is false, therefore, we progress to the else statement.
We run the statement in the indent.
This corresponds to the individual attending the Meat Loaf concert.
The program will then continue running.
For the case where the age is 19, we set the value of the variable age to 19.
We check the if statement.
The statement is true, therefore, the program will execute the statement to print �you
will enter.�
The program skips the expressions in the else statement and continues to run the rest of
the expressions.
The elif statement, short for �else if,� allows us to check additional conditions,
if the proceeding condition is false.
If the condition is true, the alternate expressions will be run.
Consider the concert example, if the individual is 18, they will go to the Pink Floyd concert,
instead of attending the ACDC or Meat Loaf concert.
The person of 18 years of age enters the area as they are not over 19 years of age.
They cannot see ACDC, but as they are 18 years, they attend Pink Floyd.
After seeing Pink Floyd, they move on.
The syntax of the �elseif statement� is similar.
We simply add the statement elseif with the condition.
We then add the expression we would like to execute if the statement is true, with an
indent.
Let's illustrate the code on the left.
An 18-year-old enters.
They are not older than 18 years of age, therefore the condition is false, so the condition of
the else if statement is checked.
The condition is true, so then we would print �go see Pink Floyd.�
Then we would move on, as before.
If the variable age was 17, the statement �go see Meat Loaf� would print.
Similarly, if the age was greater than 18, the statement �you can enter� would print.
Check the labs for more examples.
Now let�s take a look at logic operators.
Logic operations take Boolean values and produce different Boolean values.
The first operation is the not operator.
If the input is true, the result is a false.
Similarly, if the input is false, the result is a true.
Let A and B represent Boolean variables.
The �or� operator takes in the two values, and produces a new Boolean value.
We can use this table to represent the different values.
The first column represents the possible values of A.
The second column represents the possible values of B.
The final column represents the result of applying the "or" operation.
We see the "or" operator only produces a false if all the Boolean values are false.
The following lines of code will print out: �This album was made in the 70's or 90's�
if the variable album year does not fall in the 80s.
Let's see what happens when we set the album year to 1990.
The colored number line is green when the condition is true and red when the condition
is false.
In this case, the condition is true.
Examining the second condition, we see that 1990 is greater than 1989, so the condition
is also true.
We can verify by examining the corresponding second number line.
In the final number line, the green region indicates where the area is true.
This region corresponds to where at least one statement is true.
We see that 1990 falls in the area.
Therefore we execute the statement.
Let A and B represent Boolean variables the "and" operator takes in the two values,
and produces a new Boolean value.
We can use this table to represent the different values.
The first column represents the possible values of A.
The second column represents the possible values of B.
The final column represents the result of applying the "and" operation.
We see the "or" operator only produces a true if all the Boolean values are true.
The following lines of code will print out: �This album was made in the 80�s� if
the variable album year is between 1980 and 1989.
Let's see what happens when we set the album year to 1983.
As before, we can use the colored number line to examine where the condition is true.
In this case, 1983 is larger than 1980, so the condition is true.
Examining the second condition, we see that 1990 is greater than 1983 so this condition
is also true.
We can verify by examining the corresponding second number line.
In the final number line, the green region indicates where the area is true.
Similarly, this region corresponds to where both statements are true.
We see that 1983 falls in the area.
Therefore we execute the statement.
Branching allows us to run different statements for different inputs.*

*Understand if statements, loops (for and while), and basic error handling.*  

**Task 4: User Input and Conditionals**  
Create a script that takes user input for their age. Based on the age, print different messages. For example:  
```
If the age is less than 18, print "You are a minor."
If the age is between 18 and 65 (inclusive), print "You are an adult."
If the age is 65 or older, print "You are a senior citizen."
```
Remember to convert the user input to an integer using int().
___


**Task 8: Even or Odd**  
Write a script that takes an integer as user input and prints whether the number is even or odd.  
Remember to convert user input to the appropriate data type when necessary.
___

*Me:*  
I'm having trouble with a syntax error in part 8, though, however I'm confident the logic is sound:
```py
## Even or odd

# Request input (and check it's an integer)
while True:
    try:
        number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter an integer: ")

# Check if Zero
if number == 0:
    print("0 is neither odd nor even")
# Check if odd
    elif number == odd:
        print(number, "is an odd number")
# Check if even
    else number == even:
        print(number, "is an odd number")
```

*ChatGPT:*  
You're close! The issue seems to be with the indentation and the structure of your if-elif-else block. Here's the corrected version:
```python
## Even or odd

# Request input (and check it's an integer)
while True:
    try:
        number = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
        break  # Break out of the loop if input is successfully converted to an integer
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter an integer.")

# Check if Zero
if number == 0:
    print("0 is neither odd nor even")
# Check if odd
elif number % 2 != 0:
    print(number, "is an odd number")
# Check if even
else:
    print(number, "is an even number")
```
Here are the changes:

    I added a break statement after successfully converting the input to an integer to exit the while loop.

    Fixed the indentation for the elif and else blocks.

    Changed number == odd to number % 2 != 0 to check if the number is odd.

    Removed the unnecessary even and odd variables.

*Me:*  
So indentation is not a good idea?

*ChatGPT:*  
Indentation is crucial in Python; it's not just a matter of style but a fundamental aspect of the language's syntax. In Python, indentation is used to define blocks of code and is a key part of the language's readability. Unlike other languages that use braces or keywords like begin and end to define code blocks, Python relies on indentation.

Here's why indentation is important:

    Readability: Proper indentation makes your code more readable and easier to understand. It visually represents the structure of your code.

    Code Blocks: In Python, indentation defines code blocks. Statements at the same indentation level are part of the same block. This is in contrast to languages that use braces (e.g., {}) to denote blocks.

    Enforces Consistency: Consistent indentation is enforced by the Python interpreter. If indentation is inconsistent, it will result in an IndentationError.

In your code, the if, elif, and else blocks should be indented at the same level. Incorrect indentation can lead to syntax errors or unexpected behavior.

For example, in your original code:
```py

# Incorrect indentation
if number == 0:
    print("0 is neither odd nor even")
# Check if odd
elif number == odd:
    print(number, "is an odd number")
# Check if even
else number == even:
    print(number, "is an odd number")
```

The elif and else blocks are not indented correctly, leading to a syntax error.  
The corrected version indents them at the same level:
```python

# Correct indentation
if number == 0:
    print("0 is neither odd nor even")
# Check if odd
elif number % 2 != 0:
    print(number, "is an odd number")
# Check if even
else:
    print(number, "is an even number")
```

Correct indentation is crucial for writing correct and readable Python code.

<h2 id="cond">Condition Statements</h2>

<h3 id="comp">Comparison Operators</h3>

Comparison operations compare some value or operand and based on a condition, produce a Boolean. When comparing two values you can use these operators:

<ul>
    <li>equal: <b>==</b></li>
    <li>not equal: <b>!=</b></li>
    <li>greater than: <b>></b></li>
    <li>less than: <b>&lt;</b></li>
    <li>greater than or equal to: <b>>=</b></li>
    <li>less than or equal to: <b>&lt;=</b></li>
</ul>

Let's assign <code>a</code> a value of 5. Use the equality operator denoted with two equal <b>==</b> signs to determine if two values are equal. The case below compares the variable <code>a</code> with 6.

# Condition Equal

a = 5
a == 6
The result is <b>False</b>, as 5 does not equal to 6.

Consider the following equality comparison operator: <code>i > 5</code>. If the value of the left operand, in this case the variable <b>i</b>, is greater than the value of the right operand, in this case 5, then the statement is <b>True</b>. Otherwise, the statement is <b>False</b>.  If <b>i</b> is equal to 6, because 6 is larger than 5, the output is <b>True</b>.

# Greater than Sign

i = 6
i > 5
Set <code>i = 2</code>. The statement is False as 2 is not greater than 5:

# Greater than Sign

i = 2
i > 5
 Let's display some values for <code>i</code> in the figure. Set the values greater than 5 in green and the rest in red. The green region represents where the condition is **True**, the red where the statement is **False**. If the value of <code>i</code> is 2, we get **False** as the 2 falls in the red region. Similarly, if the value for <code>i</code> is 6 we get a **True** as the condition falls in the green region. 

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/CondsGreater.gif" width="650">

The inequality test uses an exclamation mark preceding the equal sign, if two operands are not equal then the condition becomes **True**.  For example, the following condition will produce **True** as long as the value of <code>i</code> is not equal to 6:

# Inequality Sign

i = 2
i != 6
When <code>i</code> equals 6 the inequality expression produces <b>False</b>. 

# Inequality Sign

i = 6
i != 6
See the number line below. When the condition is **True**, the corresponding numbers are marked in green and for where the condition is **False** the corresponding number is marked in red.  If we set <code>i</code> equal to 2 the operator is true, since 2 is in the green region. If we set <code>i</code> equal to 6, we get a **False**, since the condition falls in the red region.

 We can apply the same methods on strings. For example, we can use an equality operator on two different strings. As the strings are not equal, we get a **False**.

# Use Equality sign to compare the strings

"ACDC" == "Michael Jackson"
 If we use the inequality operator, the output is going to be **True** as the strings are not equal.

# Use Inequality sign to compare the strings

"ACDC" != "Michael Jackson"
The inequality operation is also used to compare the letters/words/symbols according to the ASCII value of letters. The decimal value shown in the following table represents the order of the character:

For example, the ASCII code for <b>!</b> is 33, while the ASCII code for <b>+</b> is 43. Therefore <b>+</b> is larger than <b>!</b> as 43 is greater than 33.

Similarly, from the table above we see that the value for <b>A</b> is 65, and the value for <b>B</b> is 66, therefore:

# Compare characters

'B' > 'A'
 When there are multiple letters, the first letter takes precedence in ordering:

# Compare characters

'BA' > 'AB'
<b>Note</b>: Upper Case Letters have different ASCII code than Lower Case Letters, which means the comparison between the letters in Python is case-sensitive.

<h3 id="branch">Branching</h3>

 Branching allows us to run different statements for different inputs. It is helpful to think of an **if statement** as a locked room, if the statement is **True** we can enter the room and your program will run some predefined tasks, but if the statement is **False** the program will ignore the task.

For example, consider the blue rectangle representing an ACDC concert. If the individual is older than 18, they can enter the ACDC concert. If they are 18 or younger, they cannot enter the concert.

We can use the condition statements learned before as the conditions that need to be checked in the **if statement**. The syntax is as simple as <code> if <i>condition statement</i> :</code>, which contains a word <code>if</code>, any condition statement, and a colon at the end. Start your tasks which need to be executed under this condition in a new line with an indent. The lines of code after the colon and with an indent will only be executed when the **if statement** is **True**. The tasks will end when the line of code does not contain the indent.

In the case below, the code <code>print(“you can enter”)</code> is executed only if the variable <code>age</code> is greater than 18 is a True case because this line of code has the indent. However, the execution of <code>print(“move on”)</code> will not be influenced by the if statement.

# If statement example

age = 19
#age = 18

#expression that can be true or false
if age > 18:
    
    #within an indent, we have the expression that is run if the condition is true
    print("you can enter" )

#The statements after the if statement will run regardless if the condition is true or false 
print("move on")
<i>Try uncommenting the age variable</i>

It is helpful to use the following diagram to illustrate the process. On the left side, we see what happens when the condition is <b>True</b>.  The person enters the ACDC concert representing the code in the indent being executed; they then move on. On the right side, we see what happens when the condition is <b>False</b>; the person is not granted access, and the person moves on. In this case, the segment of code in the indent does not run, but the rest of the statements are run.

The <code>else</code> statement runs a block of code if none of the conditions are **True** before this <code>else</code> statement. Let's use the ACDC concert analogy again. If the user is 17 they cannot go to the ACDC concert,  but they can go to the Meatloaf concert.
The syntax of the <code>else</code> statement is similar as the syntax of the <code>if</code> statement, as <code>else :</code>. Notice that, there is no condition statement for <code>else</code>.
Try changing the values of <code>age</code> to see what happens:  

# Else statement example

age = 18
# age = 19

if age > 18:
    print("you can enter" )
else:
    print("go see Meat Loaf" )
    
print("move on")
The process is demonstrated below, where each of the possibilities is illustrated on each side of the image. On the left is the case where the age is 17, we set the variable age to 17, and this corresponds to the individual attending the Meatloaf concert. The right portion shows what happens when the individual is over 18, in this case 19, and the individual is granted access to the concert.

The <code>elif</code> statement, short for else if, allows us to check additional conditions if the condition statements before it are <b>False</b>. If the condition for the <code>elif</code> statement is <b>True</b>, the alternate expressions will be run. Consider the concert example, where if the individual is 18 they will go to the Pink Floyd concert instead of attending the ACDC or Meat-loaf concert. A person that is 18 years of age enters the area, and as they are not older than 18 they can not see ACDC, but since they are 18 years of age, they attend  Pink Floyd. After seeing Pink Floyd, they move on. The syntax of the <code>elif</code> statement is similar in that we merely change the <code>if</code> in the <code>if</code> statement to <code>elif</code>.

# Elif statment example

age = 18

if age > 18:
    print("you can enter" )
elif age == 18:
    print("go see Pink Floyd")
else:
    print("go see Meat Loaf" )
    
print("move on")
The three combinations are shown in the figure below.  The left-most region shows what happens when the individual is less than 18 years of age. The central component shows when the individual is exactly 18. The rightmost shows when the individual is over 18.

 Look at the following code:

# Condition statement example

album_year = 1983
album_year = 1970

if album_year > 1980:
    print("Album year is greater than 1980")
    
print('do something..')
Feel free to change <code>album_year</code> value to other values -- you'll see that the result changes!

Notice that the code in the above <b>indented</b> block will only be executed if the results are <b>True</b>. 

As before, we can add an <code>else</code> block to the <code>if</code> block. The code in the <code>else</code> block will only be executed if the result is <b>False</b>.


<b>Syntax:</b> 

if (condition):
    # do something
else:
    # do something else

If the condition in the <code>if</code> statement is <b>False</b>, the statement after the <code>else</code> block will execute. This is demonstrated in the figure: 

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/CondsLogicMap.png" width="650">

# Condition statement example

album_year = 1983
#album_year = 1970

if album_year > 1980:
    print("Album year is greater than 1980")
else:
    print("less than 1980")

print('do something..')
Feel free to change the <code>album_year</code> value to other values -- you'll see that the result changes based on it!

<h3 id="logic">Logical operators</h3>


Sometimes you want to check more than one condition at once. For example, you might want to check if one condition and another condition are both **True**. Logical operators allow you to combine or modify conditions.
<ul>
    <li><code>and</code></li>
    <li><code>or</code></li>
    <li><code>not</code></li>
</ul>

These operators are summarized for two variables using the following truth tables:  

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/CondsTable.png" width="650">

The <code>and</code> statement is only **True** when both conditions are true. The <code>or</code> statement is True if one condition, or both are **True**. The <code>not</code> statement outputs the opposite truth value.

Let's see how to determine if an album was released after 1979 (1979 is not included) and before 1990 (1990 is not included). The time periods between 1980 and 1989 satisfy this condition. This is demonstrated in the figure below. The green on lines <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> represents periods where the statement is **True**. The green on line <strong>c</strong> represents where both conditions are **True**, this corresponds to where the green regions overlap. 


<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/CondsEgOne.png" width="650">

 The block of code to perform this check is given by:

# Condition statement example

album_year = 1980

if(album_year > 1979) and (album_year < 1990):
    print ("Album year was in between 1980 and 1989")
    
print("")
print("Do Stuff..")
To determine if an album was released before 1980 (1979 and earlier) or after 1989 (1990 and onward ), an or statement can be used. Periods before 1980 (1979 and earlier) or after 1989 (1990 and onward) satisfy this condition. This is demonstrated in the following figure, the color green in <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> represents periods where the statement is true. The color green in **c** represents where at least one of the conditions 
are true.  

<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-PY0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%203/images/CondsEgTwo.png" width="650">

The block of code to perform this check is given by:

# Condition statement example

album_year = 1990

if(album_year < 1980) or (album_year > 1989):
    print ("Album was not made in the 1980's")
else:
    print("The Album was made in the 1980's ")
The <code>not</code> statement checks if the statement is false:

# Condition statement example

album_year = 1983

if not (album_year == 1984):
    print ("Album year is not 1984")
