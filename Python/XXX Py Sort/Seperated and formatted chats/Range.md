Condsidering the code:
```py
# Using nested for loop and if statement
result = []
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        result.append(i**2)

print(result)
```

Can you please clarify why in `for i in range(1, 6):` we want to square the numbers 1-5, but that is expressed as `range(1, 6)`?

Certainly! The `range(start, stop)` function generates a sequence of numbers from start to stop - 1. In Python, the `range()` function is used to define a range of values, and the stop value is not included in the sequence.

So, when we use `range(1, 6)`, it generates the sequence of numbers from 1 to 5:

    1 (included)
    2
    3
    4
    5 (included)

This range is commonly used when we want to iterate through the numbers 1 to 5, inclusive. If we wanted to include the number 6 as well, we would use `range(1, 7)`.
