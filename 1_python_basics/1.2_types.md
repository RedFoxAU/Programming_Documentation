## Types
Variables in Python have different types, the 4 most common non-collection (not [lists/tuples](/2_python_data_structures/2.1_lists_and_tuples.md), [sets](/2_python_data_structures/2.2_sets.md) or [dictionaries](/2_python_data_structures/2.3_dictionaries.md)) are:  
* integers (`int`)
* strings (`str`)
* floats (`float`)
* boolean (`bool`)

The data type in Python can be determined using the `type()` statement.
```py
## Declare Variables of different types 
age = 38
height = 1.6
name = "Amanda"
check = True

print ("Name: ", name, type(name))
print ("Height: ", height, type(height))
print ("Age: ", age, type(age))
print ("Check: ", check, type(check))
```

Will output:
```
Name:  Amanda <class 'str'>
Height:  1.6 <class 'float'>
Age:  38 <class 'int'>
Check:  True <class 'bool'>
```

*See [Expressions and Variables](1.3%20Expressions%20and%20Variables.md#variables-from-user-input) for information on variables*

* **Integers:** The set of real numbers with no decimal or fraction; -1, 2, 1000 etc.
* **Floats:** Numbers that contain a decimal; 1.5, 3.14, 166.456 etc.
* **Strings:** A Sequence of characters that can include letters, numbers or symbols; "This is a string, 33 !"
* **Boolean:** A data type that can only have one of two possible values, most commonly True/False (Note: case is important)

### Comparability 
When working with types comparability between and within types can be important, the table below shows how types may compare with eachother:

| **Type**           | **Examples**              | **Comparable Within** | **Comparable Across** | **Notes**                                                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Numeric Types**  | `int`, `float`, `complex` | Yes                   | Partially             | `int` and `float` are comparable, but `complex` numbers are not directly comparable to others.|
| **Strings**        | `"apple"`, `"banana"`     | Yes                   | No                    | Strings are compared lexicographically (alphabetically).      |
| **Booleans**       | `True`, `False`           | Yes                   | Yes                   | `True` is equivalent to `1`, and `False` is equivalent to `0`.|
| **Lists**          | `[1, 2]`, `[3, 4]`        | Yes                   | No                    | Compared element by element; elements must be comparable.     |
| **Tuples**         | `(1, 2)`, `(3, 4)`        | Yes                   | No                    | Compared element by element, like lists.                      |
| **Sets**           | `{1, 2}`, `{3, 4}`        | No                    | No                    | Sets do not support direct ordering comparisons (`<`, `>`).   |
| **Dictionaries**   | `{"a": 1}`, `{"b": 2}`    | No                    | No                    | Dictionaries are not directly comparable.                     |
| **Bytes**          | `b'abc'`, `b'def'`        | Yes                   | No                    | Comparable within type (lexicographically).                   |
| **NoneType**       | `None`                    | No                    | No                    | `None` cannot be compared with other types or even itself (except with `is`).|
| **Custom Objects** | `MyClass()`               | Optional              | Optional              | Requires custom comparison logic (e.g., implementing `__lt__`, `__eq__`).|


There are some limitations when it comes to machines representing real numbers, but floating point numbers are a good representation in most cases. The specifics of floats for a given runtime environment can be checked using `sys.float_info`. This will also show the largest and smallest number that can be represented with them (*Note: `sys` must be imported first*).

### Type Casting
Expression types can be changed in python, this is called type casting. The integer 2 can be cast to a float as follows:

<details><summary>Cast Integer to Float</summary>

```py
float(2)
```
</details>

Will output:
```
2.0
```
Note that when casting a float to an integer, information can be lost; for example casting 1.1 to an integer will result in 1.

If a string contains an integer value, it can be converted to a float or int; however this is only possible if the string contains only numerical characters; for example
<details><summary>Cast String to Integer or Float</summary>

```py
int('1')
float('1.2')
```
</details>

Will output:
```
1
1.2
```

While `int(1 and some text)` would result in an error.

Boolean can be cast to an integer or float.  
If a Boolean True is cast to an integer or float it will result in `1` or `1.0`.  
If a Boolean false is cast to an integer or float it will result in `0` or `0.0`. 
Similarly a `1`/`0` cast to boolean will result in `True`/`False` respectively.

### Advanced Type Casting
There are more advanced ways to do type casting, for example, taking an [input](/1_python_basics/1.3_expressions_and_variables.md#variables-from-user-input) (which is always a string), and casting it to an integer; however the required input type should be made clear to the user and [exception handling](/3_flow_control/3.5_exception_handling.md#exception-handling) is a very good idea.  
```py
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```
